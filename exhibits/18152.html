  <p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present Read Between the Lines guest curated by Micaela Giovannotti, an independent art curator and critic.</p>


	<p>So often the massive amount of information received on a daily basis prevents us from dissecting and absorbing the more profound layers of meaning embedded within images and text. Given that we are used to decoding language and icons, it is certainly convenient and momentarily fulfilling to gather enough knowledge from that first encounter without moving any further.</p>


	<p>The works in the group exhibition Read Between the Lines, all from artists currently in residence at the Printshop, encourage the audience to develop a longer and deeper relationship with the images on view.</p>


	<p>Some of the works formally exploit the lines in printed media to concurrently disguise and reveal, as in the prints of Shanti Grumbine, Julian Wellisz, and Daniele Genadry. In David Rios Ferreira’s and Linda Plotkin’s oeuvre, the abstract graphic elements instead look fragmented and are on a quest to be contextualized.</p>


	<p>Felix Plaza’s consumerist shopping bags are devoid of interior contents that need to be provided, whereas So Yoon Lym’s disconnected tattooed limbs present themselves aggressively on an enigmatic, narrative triptych, and Kymia Nawabi’s couple in Nook (2012) cuddle, arms outstretched toward each other, in an attempt to embrace an evanescent bubble.</p>
