<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>From April 18 – May 2, 2010, <span class="caps">PARTICIPANT INC</span> is pleased to present That&#8217;s When the Rabbit Taught the Eagle a Lesson With a Smith &#38; Wesson, an exhibition featuring an artists’ book of the same name. Both the publication and its presentation are organized by artist Jasper Sebastian Stürup, reflecting his ongoing practice of initiating and realizing projects in which he would like to be a part. Each of the participating artists works with drawing as their primary medium, and, while representing a wide range, they are all somehow united by a sense of intimacy that is an inherent a strength of drawing. As well, many have previously advanced the concept of the book as a medium. The exhibition emphasizes the artists’ book as an art object, and consists mainly of the book itself, displayed on tables with all pages viewable.</p>


	<p>All of the works included were made especially for this publication, conceived as an artwork in itself. The book is 160 pages, 25 pages by each artist, printed in an edition of 500, and available for $40. The title, That&#8217;s When the Rabbit Taught the Eagle a Lesson With a Smith &#38; Wesson, is a slightly reworked line from the song “Billy Jack,” from the album A Heavy Nite With&#8230; by Relaxed Muscle, a duo including Jarvis Cocker under the name Darren Spooner and Jason Buckle.</p>


	<p>Jasper Sebastian Stürup lives/works New York) has made over thirty artists’ books through Fluens Forlag, a company founded while the artist was studying at The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Art in 1994. Two of those books were collaborations with other artists. This is his first book in which Stürup invited several artists to take part in creating one book. Fluens Forlag will launch its own website in conjunction with this exhibition at <a href="http://www.fluensforlag.com">www.fluensforlag.com</a></p>


	<p>Barry McGee (lives/works in LA) has made several books, in which he integrates different types of photographs with his paintings, sculptures, and tags. Kristofer Hultenberg (lives/works in Copenhagen) has recently made I&#8217;m sure not, which consists of a series of precise abstract drawings. D-L Alvarez (lives/works in Berlin) and Mike Paré (lives/works in Albuquerque) work with narrative, but in very different ways. Alvarez’s neatly drawn laidback pixilated distorted images have an iconic feel to them. In Mike Paré&#8217;s drawings, skater youth culture meets a wide range of 70s style images, from concert images to the occult.</p>


	<p>On the occasion of this artists’ book exhibition, That&#8217;s When the Rabbit Taught the Eagle a Lesson With a Smith &#38; Wesson, <span class="caps">PARTICIPANT INC</span> will inaugurate a series of bookshelves devoted to nonprofit and artists’ publishing efforts, including Fluens Forlag, Regency Arts Press Ltd., Primary Information, and <span class="caps">PARTICIPANT PRESS</span>.</p>
