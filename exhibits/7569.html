<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Organized by The Horticultural Society of New York and sponsored by <span class="caps">UBS</span></p>


	<p>A new exhibition at The <span class="caps">UBS</span> Art Gallery (1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York City) will investigate the intimate bond between artists and plants through the perspective of contemporary art.  On view from August 7 through October 31, 2008 and organized by The Horticultural Society of New York, Implant will present the work of 45 artists, including Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Pipilotti Rist, Peter Coffin and Tacita Dean. Ranging from botanically accurate sculptures and paintings, to abstract gestures inspired by flora, to conceptual works suggesting artist/plant collaborations, each work is furthered by the artist’s personal connection with plants.</p>


	<p>Curated by Jodie Vicenta Jacobson of The Horticultural Society of New York, Implant will feature works in a wide variety of media, including photography, painting, works on paper, sculpture, video, film and sound, dating from 1865 to 2008.  Influenced by horticultural writer Michael Pollan’s book, The Botany of Desire, Jacobson’s exhibition concept exposes the plant’s power to infiltrate the artist’s psyche, eventually immortalizing itself as a work of art.</p>


	<p>Implant is made possible by <span class="caps">UBS</span>.</p>


	<p>One highlight of the exhibition is a work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres (1957-1996, Cuba) that employs flowering plants to symbolize identity, sexuality and mortality.  This complex set of associations is at work in Gonzalez-Torres’ photograph “Untitled” (Alice B. Toklas’ &#38; Gertrude Stein’s Grave, Paris).  Without a point of reference, the composition of flowers and plants can be interpreted simply as a beautiful picture or a conceptual gesture, as a celebration or a memorial.</p>


	<p>A pair of photographs by Pipilotti Rist (b. 1962, Switzerland) entitled Unfrisiert mit Schneeblumen is dreamlike, depicting a silhouette of a woman’s hair and a detail of magnolia flowers, offering ephemeral connections between the forms.  Tacita Dean’s (b. 1965, United Kingdom) film stills of African baobab trees address obsolescence and its relationship to nature, while representational paintings by Jane Freilicher (b. 1924, United States) and Ann Craven (United States) demonstrate the hauntingly seductive quality of flowers and the landscape.  Robert Gober (b. 1954, United States) takes the theme of seduction a step further by literally costuming a tree in a dress in an untitled graphite drawing.</p>


	<p>Conceptual works on view in the exhibition are by turns experimental, subversive and whimsical.  Peter Coffin (b. 1963, United States) creates a functioning greenhouse with a variety of plant specimens that will serve as a venue for live and recorded musical performances during which plant and musician will interact.  Simon Starling (b. 1967, United Kingdom) links unexpected coincidences in his work.  His installation at The <span class="caps">UBS</span> Art Gallery of two objects—Weeding Aralia, a chaise lounge with vibrant botanical fabric by Josef Frank, and Muscled Moore, a photograph of sculptor Henry Moore’s Reclining Figure 1950—draws an interesting connection between these two “reclining” modern works.  Roman Signer (b. 1938, Switzerland) humorously tweaks the scientific method by testing various collisions and explosions, then capturing these “action sculptures” in photographs and video, as seen in the video Weihnachtsbaum/Christmas Tree.  Signer’s photograph Leiter/Ladder shows red balloons wedged between each rung of a wooden ladder that is leaning against an apple tree, mysteriously suggesting previous unseen events.</p>
