  <p>Alison Owen: Shelf Life is curated by Zeljka Himbele Kozul.</p>


	<p>Alison Owen’s installation <em>Shelf Life</em> came out of close observation of the Lower East Side neighborhood and its continual transformation, as well as respective functions, appearances and usual daily operations of both the Essex Street Market and Cuchifritos gallery. The work is inspired by the distinctions, similarities, overlaps and interactions of these two environments. Similar to Owen’s other works, this site-specific installation responds to the particular architectural properties—formal qualities as well as spatial patterns—of the Market and the gallery space, and is constructed out of modest and/or ephemeral materials, which seemingly grow from and within the architecture. It combines previously used art display furniture with the objects given to the artist by the Market vendors, along with the various materials found in situ. The installation seems like a half-finished store, simultaneously emerging from the context of the market and melting back into it.</p>
