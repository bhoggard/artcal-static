  <p>4heads proudly presents the <strong>Fifth Annual Governors Island Art Fair</strong>, which will be free and open to the public every Saturday and Sunday, September 1 – 30, 2012 from 11am to 6pm.  Powered by a group of New York-based working artists, this event calls together more than 100 international artists to exhibit their work in the landmark architecture of Governors Island in New York Harbor.</p>


	<p>When it began in 2008, the <strong>Governors Island Art Fair</strong> was little more than an idea to bring under-represented art to unused public space; the first edition had 50 exhibitors and no funding.  Still, this fine art fair without the fuss drew thousands of visitors.  The event doubled in size the next year and it continues to grow.  In his article “An Art Fair for the Artists,” arts writer Franklin Einspruch describes the <strong>Governors Island Art Fair</strong> as “a refreshing exception” to other fairs.</p>


	<p>This year, the 4heads jury has chosen dynamic talents from around the world to participate in what will be the largest and most exciting iteration of the fair to date. Artists are selected based solely on the merit of their work, and each gets free space and free reign to create a unique exhibition environment.  “We believe artists know what is best for their own work,” the founders explain.</p>


	<p>The <strong>Fifth Annual Governors Island Art Fair</strong> will span 150 rooms and attic spaces in the historic Army and Coast Guard housing on the southeast corner of the island.  A fair-goer’s experience will change around every corner with fresh examples of all media: painting, photography, sculpture, video, drawings, performance, installation, and everything in between.  Some of the 2012 highlights will include: Parisian artist <strong>Aldo Carreda’s</strong> haunting works with altered fingerprints; performance by New York’s <strong>Ambrose Martos</strong>; a large diorama of politicized faux Hummel figurines by Berlin-born <strong>Tine Kindermann</strong>; and work by collagist, animator and sculptor, <strong>Mac Premo of Brooklyn</strong>.  Among the more than 100 independent artists exhibiting, select organizations including <strong>Golden Artist Colors</strong>, <strong><span class="caps">NYFA</span></strong>, and the U.K.’s <strong>Surface Gallery</strong> will be showing and supporting many of their artists as well.  A complete list of exhibitors can be found on the event website, <strong><a href="http://www.4heads.org">www.4heads.org</a></strong>.</p>


	<p>Special events, salons, and live music will be interspersed throughout the fair again this year. Attendees can expect additional programming to appear on Opening Day and the Grand Finale in particular.  Check <strong><a href="http://www.4heads.org">www.4heads.org</a></strong> for schedules and updates.</p>


	<p>4heads and the <strong>Governors Island Art Fair</strong> are led by founding members <strong>Nicole Laemmle</strong>, <strong>Jack Robinson</strong>, <strong>Ernie Sandidge</strong>, and <strong>Antony Zito</strong>, and are supported by the hard work of many volunteers.  With an emphasis on beautifying unused spaces, the group is committed to providing diverse venues and forums to present, advocate and serve artists everywhere.</p>


	<p>The <strong>Governors Island Art Fair</strong>( occupies Building 12, sections D, E, H, I and P.  Admission is free. Hours are 11am &#8211; 6pm on Saturdays and Sundays, September 1 – 30, 2012. Catalogues will be available for purchase for $20.</p>


	<p>Governors Island is accessible by a free 7-minute ferry ride from the Battery Maritime Building (10 South Street) in Lower Manhattan or a 3-minute ferry ride from Brooklyn Bridge Park’s Pier 6 (at the end of Atlantic Avenue, at Columbia Street) in Brooklyn.
