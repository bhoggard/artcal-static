<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Norte Maar is pleased to present <strong>Paul D’Agostino: Appearance Adrift in the Garden</strong>. This is the first one-person exhibition of the artist’s work and will feature new prints and collages in which color, time, and subject fade into and feed off of one another. The exhibition opens with a reception for the artist on February 3 from 6-9pm. A reading from the artist’s latest chapbook, published in collaboration with Norte Maar, will take place on Sunday, February 19 at 4pm. The gallery at Norte Maar is open weekends 1-6pm. This exhibition continues through March 4. For more information please call 646-361-8512 or visit <a href="http://www.nortemaar.org">www.nortemaar.org</a></p>


	<p>Paul D’Agostino is an artist who translates, severs, layers, wipes out and remakes images. His semantic abilities and linguistic fluidity are matched by the variations in materials the artist uses to make work, work that is infused with an adrenaline, an intellectual rigor and a clarity that has made this artist an important one to watch. In this one-person show, the artist’s first, D’Agostino presents, along with new collage work, two recent sets of serialized monoprints in which image and repetition battle for recognition on a surface steadied by one’s ability to source a story and make sense in circumstance.</p>


	<p>A new publication of writings by D’Agostino titled Bodies, Voids and a Tale of Seas, is a literal and metaphorical appendage to the artwork and will accompany the exhibit. It features poetry in several languages, with translations provided, as well a short story, Anchors. This is a limited edition publication and will be available at a reading at the gallery on Sunday, February 19, at 4pm.</p>


	<p><strong>More about the artist</strong>:
Paul D’Agostino is an artist, writer and translator living in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where he also curates art exhibits at Centotto, otherwise known as the living room of his shared loft. He holds a Ph.D. in Italian Literature and is Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures at <span class="caps">CUNY</span> Brooklyn College, where he also works in the Art Department as a writing advisor. D’Agostino writes in and translates among a number of different languages, primarily Italian, German, French, Spanish and English, and he is Contributing Editor at The L Magazine, Assistant Editor of Journal of Italian Translation and co-founder of a new blog devoted to art writing, After Vasari. His poetry and prose have appeared in several different Brooklyn-based magazines, and his mixed-media, often language-based artworks have been featured in many group exhibits, mostly in Brooklyn and Philadelphia. Appearance Adrift in the Garden is his first solo exhibit.</p>
