  <p>Taller Boricua presents <em>See What I Mean</em>, a group exhibition featuring: Anibal Arroyo, Nicky Enright, Sandra María Esteves, Nicholas Fraser, Caridad De La Luz &#8220;La Bruja,&#8221; Soraya Marcano, Joetta Maue, Elsa María Meléndez, Jesús Papoleto Meléndez, Antonio “Titanium” Montalvo, Christian “XIAN” Montalvo, Urayoán Noel, Ronny Quevedo, David Quiles, Wilson Ramos Jr., Oliver Rios, Karen Shaw and Seldon Yuan. The exhibition is curated by Marcos Dimas and Christine Licata</p>


	<p>Bringing together visual artists and Nuyorican poets, the exhibition explores the elastic nature of verbal and visual language. Relationships between how we see and the way we describe the world around us are malleable and intrinsically connected. Within this discourse, the ongoing contributions and legacy of the Nuyorican poets offer important insight. (Re)inventors of the vernacular, they continually encompass other art mediums and expand the boundaries between that which is seen, said and experienced in culture.</p>


	<p>Together with visual artists whose work also exists in a realm between expression and perception, the exhibition provokes an expansive dialogue on familiar socio-political realities and constructs of everyday life such as: identity, economics, interpersonal relationships, public media and government practices. Incorporating multimedia installations drawing, collage, found objects as well as digital and traditional printmaking, “See What I Mean” offers a look beyond the surface of words and images to reveal deeper understandings.</p>
