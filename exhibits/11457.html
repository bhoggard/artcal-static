<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>The Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to announce <em>Editions &#8216;10: Catalogue Launch and Exhibition</em>. With a catalogue essay by independent print curator, advisor, and appraiser Sarah Kirk Hanley, the publication and exhibition will feature new works created by recipients of the Printshop’s Special Editions Residencies: Karlos Carcamo, Cammi Climaco, and Steve Lambert, and recipients of the Printshop’s Publishing Residencies: Enoc Perez and William Powhida.</p>


	<p>The Special Editions Residency provides emerging artists with the opportunity to create an important new body of work in collaboration with master printers, fully sponsored by the Printshop. Karlos Carcamo’s autobiographical series of prints, Cammi Climaco’s mixed media print installation, and Steve Lambert’s subversive yet humorous play on words are the first prints created by all three artists, and represent new directions in their own work as well as pushing the boundaries of contemporary printmaking.</p>


	<p>The Printshop&#8217;s Art and Editions Committee awarded two Publishing Residencies in 2009/2010, inviting Enoc Perez and William Powhida to collaborate with the Printshop’s master printers on a new body of work. Enoc Perez used multiple printed and hand-painted layers to create a series of unique prints exploring Modernist architecture, while William Powhida continued to push his biting satire on the art world, generating a series of hand colored etchings and exploring the silkscreen process for the first time. These projects showcase the artists’ most ambitious print projects to-date.</p>


	<p><strong>Karlos Carcamo</strong> received his M.F.A from Hunter College, and his B.F.A from the School of Visual Arts, both in New York. He attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in 1998, and from 2006 through 2009 was co-director of Go North -A Space for Contemporary Art, Beacon, NY.</p>


	<p><strong>Cammi Climaco</strong> completed her <span class="caps">MFA</span> at Cranbrook Academy of Art and received her B.F.A from Kent State University, Kent, Ohio. She has exhibited nationally and internationally, most recently showing at Lump, Raleigh, NC and Frontroom, Brooklyn, NY. Working primarily in sculpture and installation, she uses strategies from pop music to engage with in an attempt to observe their effects and suggest alternative ways to write and read these histories.</p>


	<p><strong>Steve Lambert</strong> received his M.FA from UC Davis and his B.FA from the San Francisco Art Institute. He is the founder of the Anti-Advertising Agency, lead developer of Add-Art (an add-on that replaces online advertising with art) and has collaborated with numerous artists including the Graffiti Research Lab, and the Yes Men. His work has won awards from Prix Ars Electronica, Rhizome/The New Museum, the Creative Work Fund, Adbusters Media Foundation, the California Arts Council, and many others.</p>


	<p><strong>Enoc Perez</strong> received his M.F.A. from Hunter College and B.F.A. from Pratt, both in New York. He has exhibited in museums and galleries in the Americas and Europe, including the Centre Pompidou, Paris; The Collezione Maramotti, Reggio Emilia, Italy; the <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Connecticut; and El Museo del Barrio, New York. He is represented in New York by Mitchell-Innes &#38; Nash.</p>


	<p><strong>William Powhida</strong> received his M.F.A from Hunter College and his B.F.A from Syracuse University. He has exhibited in New York, Seattle, Miami, Los Angeles, London, Madrid, and Belgium. His most recent show #class at the Winkleman Gallery, a collaboration with Jennifer Dalton, received rave reviews in the New York Times and Artforum.com. Powhida is represented in New York by Schroeder Romero+Shredder, by Charlie James Gallery in Los Angeles, and Platform Gallery in Seattle.</p>


	<p><strong>Sarah Kirk Hanley</strong> is an independent print curator, advisor, and appraiser. She received her MA in Museum Education from The University of the Arts in Philadelphia, and her <span class="caps">BFA</span> in Printmaking and Art History from the University of Iowa. She has previously worked as Associate Curator and Head of the Prints, Drawings, and Photographs department at the Milwaukee Art Museum, and as a specialist within Christie’s New York Print department. She has also held positions at the Lower East Side Printshop in New York and the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Wisconsin.</p>
