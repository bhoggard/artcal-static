  <p>Pattern Variants New York Edition</p>


	<p>Writing Installation:
Thursday, May 24, 10am-1pm
Friday, May 25, 6pm-9pm
Saturday, May 26, 10am-1pm</p>


	<p>This event is free and open to the public.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">USTREAM</span> Live Broadcast
On channel: Pattern Variants New York Edition AC Institute</p>


	<p>The collaborative writing installation, Pattern Variants, will be open to the public and available for viewing on <span class="caps">LIVE WEBCAST</span>.   Conceived, directed, and produced by Buzz Evers, Pattern Variants represents the first of three programs focused on the art of dialogue and the collaborative process.
Pattern Variants is a new writing experiment highlighting the poetic techniques of <span class="caps">OULIPIAN</span> and <span class="caps">LINKED POETRY</span> featuring the work of Daniel Levin Becker, Roman Muradov, Max Giteck Duykers and nine distinguished NY poets, including Marcella Durand, Anselm Berrigan, Paolo Javier, Lee Ann Brown, Tim Trace Peterson, Johanna Fuhrman, Vincent Katz, Adeena Karasick, and Jena Osman, with Edmund Berrigan serving as an alternate for the last set of rotations.</p>


	<p>Executed over three days (May 24-26), in 3 three hour sessions, Pattern Variants brings together nine landmarks chosen by our nine poets, including Harryette Mullen&#8217;s Muse and Drudge; The Puppet; The Chrysler Building; The Book of Formation; The Hays Code; Moveable Type; New French Feminisms; &#8220;Sayings Of The High One&#8221; from The Poetic Edda; &#38; Breton&#8217;s &#8216;L&#8217;amour fou&#8217;.</p>


	<p>The writing installation intersects two other collaborations involving, first, a series of eight 3X3 flash fiction grids realized by Daniel Levin Becker and Roman Muradov with their own set of combinative potentials in delivering six of Italo Calvino&#8217;s Six Memos for the Next Millennium, along with two additional memos, Symmetry and Obscurity. Additionally, our sound design by Max Giteck Duykers elucidates on patterns within the writing schematic added with an undercurrent of percussive vowels. Pattern Variants sets in motion an experiment in creative writing with the liberating uses of form as the catalyst for enabling creative discourse.</p>


	<p>Contact Buzz Evers at <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="54333520313c3b212731676760143a31202e31263b7a373b39">[email&#160;protected]</a> for any additional information.</p>


	<p>Bios:</p>


	<p>Buzz Evers is an interdisciplinary artist, independent curator, arts administrator, director, and producer. He attended Pitzer College receiving a degree in organizational studies and gravitated toward the arts based on his interest in collaboration and the creative process. His diverse list of experiences include works in the visual, performing, and language arts.</p>


	<p>Labyrinths, Synergies, and the Art of Dialogue represents a return to earlier themes bridging his interest in the traditions of linked poetry and the constraint driven propensities of the OuLiPo group of writers, poets, and mathematicians. The three programs developed under the guise of its leading title illustrate Evers&#8217; commitment toward interdisciplinary projects that explore the requisite synergies that optimize the creative dialogue, from an in-situ writing experiment with nine poets (Pattern Variants); a libretto written by seven poets (Verse in the Circle of Fifths); and an experiment in letters by three poets on the art of the book, L&#8217;Art du Livre: ÉPÎTRES Trois.</p>


	<p>Experiences in the fine arts include serving as a studio assistant in glass, metal, and wood with additional experience as a self-taught painter. He has also served as an artists’ rights representative involving copyright, collections management administrator, and museum coordinator, with additional experiences in community development involving the promotion of educational centers for creative learning.</p>


	<p>Evers is currently in discussions with The Salmagundi Club in negotiating the use of their notable art library as both sanctuary and part muse for the seven poets collaborating on the libretto for Verse in the Circle of Fifths.</p>


	<p>Daniel Levin Becker is reviews editor of The Believer and the youngest member of the Paris-based Oulipo collective. His first book, Many Subtle Channels: In Praise of Potential Literature, was published by Harvard University Press in April 2012. He lives and works in San Francisco. 
Roman Muradov is an illustrator/cartoonist from Russia. His drawings &#38; comics appeared in the New Yorker, the New York Times, Village Voice, Washington Post, Nobrow magazine &#38; other nice places.

His &#8220;Glass Blue Cleft&#8221; was released by the Escher String Quartet on Bridge Records in 2010, and has also just won the New York Composers Circle Composers Competition. His music has been featured at festivals throughout the U.S. and abroad, including the Seattle Chamber Players’ Icebreaker IV, curated by The New Yorker’s Alex Ross. He has also been commissioned to compose music for over 35 theatrical, dance, film, and multimedia projects in the New York City area. He is a PhD candidate at Stony Brook University where he studies with Sheila Silver.</p>

She has talked about the potential intersections of poetry and ecology at Kelly Writers House, Poets House, Small Press Traffic, Naropa University, and other venues. Her essays and poetry have appeared in The Nation, Ecopoetics, <span class="caps">NYFA</span> Current, Conjunctions, The Poker, <acronym title="2">HOW</acronym>, Critiphoria, The Denver Quarterly, and other journals.

Karasick has lectured and performed worldwide and regularly publishes articles, reviews and dialogues on contemporary poetry, poetics and cultural/semiotic theory.
