<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Exit Art is pleased to present Collective / Performative, an exhibition and event series focusing on performance practices that require the participation of an audience. The exhibition will include new works by commissioned artists and organizations that will utilize Exit Art&#8217;s space during gallery hours for a public project, as well as an &#8220;artists’ history&#8221; of performance told by seminal performance artists who have exhibited at Exit Art. A research exhibition that explores the history of collective practices, the exhibition also investigates the importance of the viewer/audience in achieving the work’s goals and the role that documentation and new technologies play in the formation of collective strategies.</p>


	<p>This exhibition responds to the abundance of recent attention given to performance art and specifically to the shifting terms used to define viewer engagement: &#8220;collaborative,&#8221; &#8220;relational,&#8221; &#8220;participatory,&#8221; and &#8220;delegated&#8221; to name a few. From the Performa Biennial to Creative Time’s “Living as Form” to the increased offerings of academic degrees in performance art and curatorial practice, Collective / Performative interrogates potential new performance structures and forms as investigated by artists and organizations.</p>


	<p>Collective / Performative is comprised of two parts: eight newly commissioned, performance works that require viewer participation and an “artists’ history” of performance art. Exit Art has invited artists, alternative spaces, a blog on contemporary art and culture, and a curatorial collective to organize “performative” projects at Exit Art for the duration of one week each, providing many with the opportunity to work in a collective manner for the first time. Participants will utilize the space during gallery hours as an office, studio, hub, production center, exhibition, presentation, and/or rehearsal space, and are encouraged to end their weeklong residency with a culminating event or performance. The artists’ history of performance art consists of more than one dozen interviews with artists on their influences and work, and elaborates on the historical precedents, concepts, and themes that have shaped collective practices in contemporary performa nce.</p>


	<p>In the spirit of Exit Art’s extensive history of showcasing “live” art, and presenting such historical performance exhibitions as &#8220;Tehching Hsieh, One-Year Performance 1981-1982&#8221; (1983), &#8220;Let the Artist Live!&#8221; (1994), &#8220;Endurance&#8221; (1995), &#8220;Body and the East&#8221; (2001) and &#8220;Regina José Galindo&#8221; (2009), we view Collective / Performative in a spirit particular to Exit Art: one that embodies both curatorial experimentation and the offering of new creative opportunities. This exhibition will run concurrently with Every Exit is an Entrance: 30 Years of Exit Art, which together comprise the final exhibitions at Exit Art before its closure on June 1, 2012.</p>


	<p>Collective / Performative was conceived by Jeanette Ingberman and Papo Colo and is curated by Rachel Gugelberger, Senior Curator, and Lauren Rosati, Assistant Curator, with Verity Combe, Curatorial Assistant.</p>

	<p>Exit Art is an independent vision of contemporary culture that is prepared to react immediately to important issues that affect our lives. We present experimental, historical and unique programming of aesthetic, social, political and environmental issues. Founded in 1982 by Directors Jeanette Ingberman and Papo Colo, Exit Art has grown from a pioneering alternative art space into an innovative cultural center that is committed to supporting artists whose work reflects on the socio-political transformations of our time. Exit Art is internationally recognized for its unmatched spirit of inventiveness, curatorial innovation and depth of programming in diverse media. Exit Art is always changing.</p>
