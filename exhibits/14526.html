  <p>Ghost Moth: a new Sculptural Installation
Amanda Dow Thompson</p>


	<p>Brooklyn, NY, August 2011 &#8211; Causey Contemporary is pleased to announce the opening of their October exhibition, Ghost Moth by Amanda Dow Thompson.   Ms. Thompson will be creating an installation of her carved wood, cast resin and cast glass sculptures which viewers will be able to walk in and around.  The exhibition which marks Ms. Thompson’s third show with the gallery will run from October 6 &#8211; November 6, 2011 at the gallery’s Williamsburg Brooklyn location &#8211; 92 Wythe Avenue near the corner of N. 11 Street.  A public reception will be held with the artists on Thursday October 6th from 6 &#8211; 9 p.m. Followed by a late night on Friday October 7 where the gallery will again be open until 9 p.m. as part of the Williamsburg Every 2nd Fridays.</p>


	<p>Ghost Moth on a physical level is a continuing exploration by Amanda Dow Thompson of the dance between light and shadow created when her intricately carved wood or cast resin/glass sculptures are hung in groups, lit and spun.   The effect is similar to the ghost moth, which flits through the forest in the evening light.</p>


	<p>Amanda Dow Thompson says that her work has always been concerned with people’s perception of reality.  Tension is created by permanent, three-dimensional forms, juxtaposed with transient, translucent or illusory marks.   Weighty solid materials are cajoled into contortion, yet they melt and become frail, full of air.   The recent sculptures of which those from Ghost Moth are a part, experiment with new materials for the artist and focus on repetition and/or pattern.   For Amanda, they represent finding one’s voice in the modern world, with its ever-blurring roles and boundaries socially, culturally and politically.   The play is upon the tensions created by contradictions, the vulnerable nourished by the strong, the graphic spotlighting the organic.   Above all she hopes the work poses the question of whether the beguiling can have as much resonance as the truth.</p>


	<p>Amanda received her <span class="caps">BFA</span> in Painting from Rhode Island School of Design and a BA in English Literature from The University of London.  She has studied Printmaking at the Royal College of Art and Graphic Design at The London College of Printing.  She has been interviewed about her work by TV Espanola and Radio Cadena Sur in Spain and various London publications. As well as showing with Ch’i Contemporary Fine Art in Williamsburg, NY, she has also, more recently, collaborated with Antonio Moran and completed a residency at the Espacio Moran de Arte Contemporaneo in Caceres, Spain following her one person show there in 2005. Her drawings have been exhibited at The Royal College of Art and drawings as well as sculpture at Collins and Hastie Gallery in Chelsea, London.  She has participated in group and solo shows and art fairs in London, Amsterdam, Sao Paulo and on both coasts of the <span class="caps">USA</span>. Her work was recently selected for the ArtPrize competition show at the Grand Rapids Public Museum in Fall 2010</p>


	<p>Ghost Moth will open at Causey Contemporary on October 6th with a public reception from 6 &#8211; 9 p.m. and then run through November 6, 2011.  The public is invited to attend the reception or visit the gallery during normal gallery hours : Wed-Sat. 11 a.m. &#8211; 6 p.m. Sun. 12 &#8211; 6 p.m. and Mon. 9 a.m. &#8211; 5 p.m.  For more information contact the gallery at 718 218 8939 or via email: <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9bf2f5fdf4dbf8faeee8fee2f8f4f5effef6ebf4e9fae9e2b5f8f4f6">[email&#160;protected]</a></p>
