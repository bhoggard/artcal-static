<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Causey Contemporary is pleased to announce the opening of their summer exhibition, <em>Boys with Toys</em>, featuring sculpture by Alan Binstock, Steven Dobbin, Jerry Ehrlich, Bob Emser, Arthur Mednick, Norman Mooney, John J. Richardson, Gunnar Theel and Michael Whiting.  The exhibition opens on July 20th and will be on view through August 26, 2012. An opening reception with the artists will be held on July 20th from 6-9 p.m.  Additionally, a panel discussion with the artists on sculpture in the public realm will take place on August 10, 2012, from 6-9 p.m.  Gallery hours for this exhibition will be Wed-Sun, 12-6 p.m.</p>


	<p>Curator, Tracy Causey-Jeffery selected the eight artists included in this exhibition after viewing portfolios of the 500 plus members of the International Sculpture Center organization.  Having worked with sculptors over the course of her eighteen-year career as a gallery owner and director, she has come to understand that male sculptors who often work monumentally view their equipment and indeed sometimes the products of their creation as their toys, thus the name of this summer exhibition.  Ms Causey-Jeffery’s other criteria were that the works included in the exhibition be fabricated by the sculptor’s own hand and made in large part from steel.  Other additional materials were allowed if used to enhance the fundamental steel structure.</p>


	<p>The artists featured in <em>Boys with Toys</em> include three New York based artists, Norman Mooney, Arthur Mednick and Gunnar Theel; two artists from the Maryland-D.C. Area, Alan Binstock and Steven Dobbin; two artists from the Midwest, Bob Emser and John. J. Richardson and one artist from California, Michael Whiting. Each of these sculptors brings their own aesthetic and dynamic to the exhibition.</p>


	<p>Alan Binstock’s glass, steel and resin sculptures were last seen in the New York Area in a solo exhibition at Causey Contemporary, which directly followed a solo exhibition at the Katzen Sculpture Garden at American University in D.C. His work has been reviewed by the Washington Post and Sculpture Magazine among others.  Steven Dobbin has also exhibited at Causey Contemporary in numerous solo and group exhibitions.  His most recent exhibitions include shows at the Monmouth Museum, NJ; Goucher College &#38; Stevenson University in the Baltimore area; and at <span class="caps">PULSE</span> Los Angeles. He was additionally the co-founder of <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ebaa999f84868a9f8288abad998e8f8e99828880c5">[email&#160;protected]</a>  Jerry Ehrlich is currently preparing for his first solo exhibition with Causey Contemporary in December 2012, having just completed a solo show at the Newport Museum of Art in Rhode Island. Bob Emser is an internationally recognized sculptor with exhibitions on 4 continents, 7 countries, and across the United States. He was the founder of the Chicago Sculpture International and on the Board of Directors of the International Sculpture Center. His sculpture can be found at the Swope Museum of Art, Dennos Museum, The Elmhurst Art Museum, The Mitchell Museum and The Freeport Art Museum, among others. Norman Mooney is a nationally recognized sculptor who currently has works on view at the Poyforum Sequeiros Museum in Mexico City and an upcoming public installation at the Nassau County Museum in NY. He has exhibited in two solo exhibitions with Causey Contemporary and has his third solo show with the gallery coming up this September. His art is in the Geoff Isles Collection, The Richard &#38; Helen DeVos Collection, the Mint Museum, The Claridge Collection in Quebec, and Argent Ventures Collection among others.  Arthur Mednick has exhibited in touring exhibitions with the Tweed Museum and the University of Hawaii Museum; at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and the Kulturegucker in Berlin Germany, and also with Causey Contemporary. He counts playwright Edward Albee, The State of Hawaii, and Fort Hays State University among his collectors. Sculptor, John J. Richardson is the Department Chair of Art at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. He has participated in over 50 national, group exhibitions and held many one-person exhibitions – including an exhibition at the South Bend Museum of Art (2007). In March 2012, he had a one-person exhibition at the University of Minnesota-Morris.  His award-winning work is held in numerous private and public collections, including the Michigan Legacy Art Park (Ontonagon, 2002); Xiadu Park, Yanqing, China (Anastomatic Lines, 2001); the Open Air Museum of Steel Sculpture, Coalbrookdale, England (Articulated Lapse, 2003) and the Lumsden School, Lumsden, Scotland (Time Boundary, 2004). Michael Whiting, the final sculptor included in <em>Boys with Toys</em>, has had his pixelated and primitive sculptures exhibited at the Sundance Institute, Utah; The Central Utah Arts Center; the El Paseo Invitational in Palm Desert, CA; and various private galleries such as Plus Gallery in Denver, CO. He has long-term sculpture installations in Denver, CO; Albuquerque, NM; Lynwood, WA; at the Sundance Resort in Utah; at Sea Bluff Home in Laguna, CA; and at the University of Nebraska among other locations. Michael’s work is currently on view at Bringham Young University Museum of Art. This will be his first appearance with Causey Contemporary.</p>
