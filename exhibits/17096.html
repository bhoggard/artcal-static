	<p>Opening Reception: Sunday, May 6th, 6:00 &#8211; 9:00 pm</p>


	<p>Ballast Projects is pleased to present Spindles, a group exhibition curated by Adam G. Mignanelli. On view will be new works by some of the most exciting emerging contemporary artists working in New York today.</p>


	<p>Spindle neurons are massive cells that allow rapid communication across the brains of highly intelligent mammals. These neurons have a strong role in cognitive abilities generally unique to humans. Spindle neurons grant us the abilities that allow us to create, and the regulation of our emotional states.</p>


	<p>Social behavior and art is the foundation of creative culture and influence. We expand our cognitive structure through natural form and geometric anomalies of contemporary art by grouping works with differing materials and textures. This visual arrangement engages us as humans, spindle neurons being the crucial relationship building components.</p>


	<p>Samuel T. Adams
Samuel T. Adams  lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. Recent exhibitions include Draw the Line, Allegra LaViola Gallery, New York, NY; The Incipient Image, Lesley Heller Workspace, New York, NY; Paper Chasers, Nudashank, Baltimore, MD; and <span class="caps">BNA</span>: Brooklyn to Nashville, ZieherSmith Pop-up Gallery in Nashville, TN.

She is represented by  Mike Weiss Gallery in New York. Virtual worlds can be found in Benson’s intuitively constructed compositions and the tension between forms and voids speak to her fascination with the cosmos. Benson’s fervor for the physical act of painting is readily evident in her mark-making; her viscous gestures evoke the onomatopoeic language of comic books taking shape as bold splunks!, shoops!, and splats! that emerge sculpturally from the surface of the canvas.</p>
