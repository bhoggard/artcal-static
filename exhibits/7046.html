  <p>Group Show curated by Queen Andrea and gmo$</p>


	<p>A group show bringing together six women painters with urban flair and creative mastery.</p>


	<p>The artists&#8217; individual styles are varied yet reflect a common perspective drawn from graffiti, typography and elements inspired by mythology, tattoo art, city life and feminism. The exhibition will feature a limited edition screenprinted set of posters, designed by the artists.</p>


	<p>Queen Andrea: A native New Yorker, Andrea&#8217;s passion for urban art and graphic design surfaced at an early age. In the early 90s, she began learning graffiti history and developed mentoring relationships with internationally notable <span class="caps">NYC</span> graffiti artists. As a young adult, she attended Parsons School of Design where she earned a <span class="caps">BFA</span> in Graphic Design and thus began a successful Graphic Design career. Based in <span class="caps">NYC</span>, Andrea works for well-known brands and companies who appreciate both the urban creative flavor of her work and her passionate knowledge of typography, branding and visual communication. These days, she is one of the most traditionally skilled female graffiti artists in the country and is enthusiastically building her design and illustration portfolios. She has been featured in numerous art shows, toy shows, magazines, books and fashion lines.</p>


	<p>gmo$: Paintings on canvas, wood and found objects. Both urban and organic elements feature prominently in this Brooklyn based painter and illustrator&#8217;s work. A longstanding appreciation of graffiti and nature continue to serve as inspiration and are recurring themes in her pieces.</p>


	<p>Toofly: An active graffiti artist, this New York born artist has participated in diverse projects and artshows. Inspired by graffiti writers at an early age, she went on to study graphic design which lead her to the creation of a set of unique female characters. Her illustrations and graffiti murals have been published in numerous books and magazines and she continues to expand her work in both the commercial and gallery realms. Toofly continues to paint, inspire, and empower women with her works.</p>


	<p>Alice Mizrachi: A New York native, hip hop culture served to help shape
Alice&#8217;s visual aesthetic. With a body of paintings inspired by the rawness
of the urban landscape, she has been involved in various projects ranging
from public art to traditional gallery forums. She is an art teacher who
enthusiastically works with children to develop their individual unique
styles. She has collaborated on product design ranging from apparel to
snowboard/skateboard companies.</p>


	<p>Muck: Muck&#8217;s painting and passion for graffiti writing has been a guiding
force even during times of wrestling with drug and alcohol addiction.
Circumstances led her to a position as graffiti writer Lady Pink&#8217;s
assistant, and it was this partnership that introduced her to mural
painting. Based in the Northeast, she continues to paint and has produced a
prolific body of work ranging from portraiture to paintings based on
letterforms and phrases.</p>


	<p>Gillian Goldstein: Gillian was born and raised in the downtown neighborhood
of Soho in <span class="caps">NYC</span>. From an early age she was profoundly influenced by graffiti,
tattoo design and street art. She later moved to SanFrancisco to earn her
<span class="caps">BFA</span> in illustration. She now resides in Brooklyn, and is a successful
apprentice tattoo artist. Her work combines east coast grit and west coast
flair with a depth of personal self reflection. Her illustration style and
portrait works encompass the energy of urban life juxtaposed with beautiful,
enchanting female personalities.</p>


	<p>³SweetCityWoman,² curated by Queen Andrea and <span class="caps">GMO</span>$ runs May 3rd through May
31st, 2008, at Fuse Gallery, 93 2nd Ave (between 5th &#38; 6th Sts, 2nd Ave stop
on the F), <span class="caps">NYC</span>, NY. The opening reception, on Saturday May 3rd, from 7 to 10
