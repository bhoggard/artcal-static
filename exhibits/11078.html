  <p><em>The Hendersons Will All Be There</em> includes collage-based work by:</p>


	<p>Dianna Frid, Jason Gringler, Matthew Rich, Steve Roden, Letha Wilson and Halley Zien</p>


	<p>The title of this show is taken from the Beatles song “Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite,” a flowing sound collage that was the most musically complex song from the seminal 1967 Sgt. Pepper’s album. During a phase in which the Beatles were experimenting with alternatives to strictly linear compositions, “Mr. Kite” was spliced together from eclectic sources utilizing modernist concepts rooted in the notion and practice of collage.</p>


	<p>Dianna Frid will include four works from her Releases series in which she uses material from earlier projects: aluminum, mylar, and fragments of cloth left over from her artist’s books. In this work, Frid began with the premise of the circle at the center of a square and created different compositional possibilities that arose from this idea. She lives and works in Chicago and exhibits at devening projects and editions.  She will have a solo show this spring at Neues Kunstforum, Cologne.</p>


	<p>Jason Gringler’s large-scale works utilize industrial materials such as cut plexiglas, mirrors, wood, acrylic and spray enamel. Through a process of construction, deconstruction and reconstruction, Gringler creates a complex and reflective work that becomes, as the viewer moves, an almost cinematic environment.  Jason Gringler is represented by Galerie Stefan Röpke in Cologne and has upcoming solo exhibitions at Parisian Laundry in Montreal and Galerie Andreas Binder in Munich.</p>


	<p>Matthew Rich‘s work is made piecemeal taping together separate painted paper shapes and growing his piece gradually in size and complexity. In this body of work, Rich explores painting as a method of building a surface based compositional structure without traditional brushwork and without a unifying backing structure.   Mathew Rich lives and works in Boston and is represented by samsøn.   He has exhibited at devening projects and editions in Chicago, IL and Project Row Houses in Houston, TX.</p>


	<p>Steve Roden works in a variety of different media using various systems and scores. Of Frozen Music and Liquid Architecture 8 uses a self-devised translation system to allow a page of classical music notation to generate a visual work. Also exhibited will be works in which Roden steps away from systems and scores to create collage with magazine cuts ups and colored pencil marks. He is represented by Susanne Vielmetter Gallery and his upcoming projects include: an artist residency and exhibition at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas and solo exhibitions at The Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena, CA and Pomona College Museum of Art in Claremont, CA.</p>


	<p>Letha Wilson uses imagery from the natural world to investigate diverse relationships between architecture and nature and between the gallery space and the American wilderness.  She embraces a range of media including photography, sculpture and collage.  Her artwork has been shown at many venues including the Bronx Museum of the Art, Socrates sculpture park, Fredrieke Taylor Gallery and the Aldrich Museum of Art.</p>


	<p>Halley Zien’s paintings seek to establish a visual language that portrays the emotional inner life of its characters. She begins with automatic sketches and then adds magazine cut outs and paint, allowing for a dialog between these elements to grow organically.  She creates distorted forms to incite an exaggerated drama. Halley Zien’s collages and drawings are currently included in the flat files at Pierogi Gallery.</p>
