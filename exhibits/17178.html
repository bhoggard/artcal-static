<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Abdolreza Aminlari and Drew Shiflett draw on traditions of minimalism, architecture, and craft to transport the viewer to a place of the imagination. For the exhibition at Storefront Bushwick, Aminlari exhibits pieces made with thread sewn on paper, Shiflett, a single, mixed-media sculpture.  The pieces exist as aesthetic objects but also function as meditations on one’s place in a specific culture or world that has both familiar and unfamiliar coordinates. The work is beautiful and mysterious, offering an entry into a poetic and exotic realm.</p>


	<p>Abdolreza Aminlari explores ideas of cultural memory and identity, specifically the idea of “home” in relation to the Iranian Diaspora. His work examines the familiar and the unknown in the territory of the physical and the subconscious. In the Compositions, Aminlari uses thread and/or ink to draw and sew on paper, a process that allows chance and repetition to guide the outcome.  The blindness of the individual repetitive action is simultaneously absent-minded and full of concentration. The outcome takes the form of false landscapes, textured fields, and topologies that recall maps of geographies that never existed or are waiting to be created.  In the untitled series of gold thread drawings, the focus is more on the domestic.  The geometric shapes reference the patterns found in Persian rugs and miniatures, while the use of gold refers to the divine and ornaments for earthly pleasure.  Intense and ethereal, the drawings are like cosmic explosions.</p>


	<p>Drew Shiflett’s sculptures are abstract in nature but reference landscape, architecture and textiles.  Mixed materials, such as handmade paper, cheesecloth, styrofoam and polyester stuffing are used to create textured, translucent surfaces.  Thin strips of cut paper layered with strips of sheer fabric produce a woven effect throughout each piece. The sculptures are the result of a cumulative process of layering and building linear and planar forms. There is a focus on line, light and texture, as well as form, transition and perception.</p>

	<p>In the project space: Cosmology</p>


	<p>“Cosmology” focuses on the work of four artists: Nancy Bowen, Matthew Mahler, Paula Overbay, and Lauren Seiden.
