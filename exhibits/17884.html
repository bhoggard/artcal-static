<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Gallery 307 is pleased to announce the opening of Intimate Information. The exhibit runs through September 6, 2012. The show features recent drawings, paintings, collages and photographs by Sara Petitt, Liz Curtin and in gallery Piccolo, Anna Ogier-Bloomer.</p>


	<p>Intimate Information explores the relationship between women and their work, women and culture and the loneliness and isolation caused by sexist and ageist environments.</p>


	<p>Petitt’s work is the continuation of a political discussion mired in fear, anger, hypocrisy and global misconstruction. It explores different cultures and the effects of sexism and violence on women and girls.</p>


	<p>Curtin’s pieces are a deeply personal monologue dealing with one woman’s experience with living alone and fighting loneliness. She addresses the issue of the female artist working within a framework often devoid of support.</p>


	<p>Both artists utilize the written word, as well as a mosaic of images and materials to convey their concerns, fears and hopes. Their work challenges the viewer to examine these issues in a uniquely personal and intimate manner.</p>


	<p>Gallery 307 is pleased to introduce gallery Piccolo, a small space within the gallery which will exhibit “response pieces” to the work in the main space.  Our inaugural show features the photographs of Anna Ogier-Bloomer. In this work Ogier-Bloomer navigates the strange shifting of roles between a mother and daughter that comes with age and the desire for understanding. Hers is a dialog connecting generations and building conversations.</p>


	<p>Gallery hours:
Tuesday-Saturday, 11am-5pm</p>


	<p>Located in Chelsea, gallery 307 is a program of the Carter Burden Center designed to give a voice to New York City’s re-emerging older professional artists. The Carter Burden Center is a non-profit agency established in 1971 by the late Carter Burden when he was a New York City Councilman.  The mission is to promote the well-being of older adults through a continuum of services, advocacy and volunteer programs oriented to individual, family and community needs.  The Carter Burden Center is dedicated to supporting the efforts of older people to live safely and with dignity.

	<p>Artist Bios</p>


	<p>Sara Petitt</p>


	<p>Sara Petitt graduated from Bennington College with a major in Fine Arts, where She studied with Paul Feeley. Ms. Petitt’s work encompasses her interests in photography, travel and writing, and often includes verbal references. This current body of work deals with women’s issues and social commentaries about them. There is no attempt to judge but rather to record issues.  The inherent motive is to highlight the need for women to have choices in the societies in which they live. Ms. Petitt has had solo shows in New York City, and has been selected for many juried shows. Her work has been collected internationally</p>


	<p>Liz Curtin</p>


	<p>Liz Curtin is always looking for new ways of seeing and exploring different media to produce work that translates her vision into a visual reality. She works in a wide range of media, including painting, collage, art journaling, bookmaking, printmaking, papermaking, quilting, and found object sculpture. In addition to her active art practice, Ms. Curtin is a teaching artist who adores her students, and makes time to perform as a singer-songwriter. She has exhibited extensively in solo and group shows, and her work is collected nationally and internationally.</p>
