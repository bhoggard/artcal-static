	<p>Josée Bienvenu Gallery is pleased to present Optimismo Radical. Bringing together twelve international artists, the exhibition is an invitation to reflect on those two words. Two redundant or contradictory words? Is Radical Optimism the opposite of moderate optimism? Or the opposite of conservative pessimism? The challenge is to articulate a series of questions, to detect some trends and attitudes.  Conceived as a project in motion, Optimismo Radical 2 will take place in São Paulo at Galeria Nara Roesler in 2011.</p>
