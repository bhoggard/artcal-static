  <p>Joshua Liner Gallery is pleased to present Memento Mori, an exhibition of new paintings by the New York-based artist Tat Ito. This occasion marks Ito’s solo debut in New York, and is his fourth appearance in shows at the gallery.</p>


	<p>Tat Ito was born and raised in Japan, but he later made his art studies in the United States. Consequently, the artist and his paintings are a dynamic confluence of East and West, traditional and contemporary. The poetic analogy of “oil on water” describes Ito’s approach to both imagery and cultural references; in his vibrantly colored work, traditional Japanese aesthetics are a foundation upon which floats a contemporary (i.e., Western-influenced) viewpoint. Like a skim of oil on water, the beautiful, reflective surfaces of his paintings fascinate viewers. These top layers never mix but, rather, are presented in dialogue with the substance beneath.</p>


	<p>This compelling relationship is explored to lustrous effect in the eight medium- to large-sized paintings of Memento Mori, which include both tondo and rectilinear canvases. In Lotus Flower and Goldfish, an acrylic on canvas tondo, Ito appropriates the pools-and-waterfalls motif from medieval Japanese painting as a palette for a contemporary overlay of Warholian silver leaf, purple polka dots, and miniature frolicking swimmers with scuba fins. Cosmos, Chrysanthemum and Dalmatian—a scroll-like, rectilinear painting in acrylic, gouache, and gold leaf on canvas— combines a running floral motif with running dogs (nearly 101 of the variety made famous in Western animation).</p>


	<p>More than merely a visual style, Ito’s use of the oil-on-water analogy comments on the experience of contemporary Japan and its deference to a Western cultural and artistic paragon. The artist aims to counter the aesthetic “semantics” of his paintings with a mysterious new context—a hybrid of East and West—that may arouse a new inquisitiveness in viewers. To this end, his work is a consideration of the ambiguities and anxieties of being in a world of two unmixable substances.</p>


	<p>Perhaps even more important to Ito, the artist, is the traditional role of the artist’s hand in creating meaningful works of art. “My hand-executed paintings, imbued with intentionality and meaning, are a direct response to the trendy ‘Factory Art’ of certain Pop and post-Pop artists and an art market fueled by brand-name investing,” says Ito. “The bustling compositions become metaphorical representations of the contemporary art world and visual culture in general. Outrageously costumed figures inhabit a stylized landscape that is simultaneously reminiscent of Japan’s high-voltage electronic age and its gold-leafed medieval era. The paintings become an arena in which my frustrations, disappointment, and hopes regarding the art  world take shape with subtle irreverence and humor.”</p>


	<p>Born in 1978 in Nagoya, Japan, Tat Ito received a <span class="caps">BFA</span> from Academy of Art University in San Francisco and an <span class="caps">MFA</span> from New York Academy of Art; he currently lives and works in Queens, New York. Selected group exhibitions of his work include: From Kojiki to Modern Heroism (with Hiro Kurata), Joshua Liner Gallery, New York (2010); Old School, Jack the Pelican, Brooklyn (2009); Art in Free Fall, Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition (BWAC) (2008); and Asobi, Sutter Gallery, San Francisco (2006).</p>
