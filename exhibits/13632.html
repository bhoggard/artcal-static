<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>bitforms gallery is pleased to announce <em>Recorded Delivery,</em> the first solo exhibition in New York by British artist Tim Knowles. It marks the United States premiere of <em>Post Box E3-HS9,</em> a collaborative project with UK Royal Mail.</p>


	<p>Tim Knowles has exhibited widely in the UK and Europe. An artist deeply committed to process, he engages invisible phenomena and uses this to shape physical experience. His work reveals hidden forces and the otherwise unnoticed timescale of objects by using specially engineered capture tools. Attracted to the energy of natural and social systems, Knowles defines chance as a crucial element of his visual discoveries.</p>


	<p>Royal Mail gave Knowles unique access to its delivery system and sanctioned his inclusion of an artist-crafted monitoring device inside a parcel. <em>Post Box E3-HS9</em> recorded its 902-mile journey from London to the Isle of Barra, in a sequence of 20,000 images, a continuous audio recording and a <span class="caps">GPS</span> track. This multitude of collected imagery and sound documented the movement of the package through the postal system.</p>


	<p>“At times, blurred pictures were taken by the moving cameras, and at others they were made in complete stillness &#8211; while the parcel sat at rest and observed the workings of the system going on around it, awaiting the next leg of it’s journey,” says Knowles.</p>


	<p>One’s sense of waiting is highlighted by the exhibition’s title; “recorded delivery” is a mail service option in the UK by which a sender obtains signature proof when a parcel has reached its destination. Quietly unfolding its unpretentious storyboard, the collected data monumentalizes everyday occurrences. Art is a means to shift one’s vantage point &#8211; and for Knowles it is a practice that enables the public to borrow his eyes; humbling oneself with world’s vitality.</p>


	<p>The package traveled 20 hours and 22 minutes. <em>Post Box E3-HS9</em> captured its own experience &#8211; carried by foot, Royal Mail vans and trucks, a Boeing 737-300 cargo plane, a small Shorts 360 propeller Aircraft and a ferry. The array of resulting imagery depicts post office interiors, sorting facilities, people at work, the processing of mail and the many different modes of transport used during its journey.</p>


	<p>The raw labor and humanness in this exercise stands at odds with the automatic process of time-lapse photography that Knowles employed for the project. Knowles explains, “There’s one lovely point when it must have been beside a door and you just hear this creaking noise like ‘eeeeeee’ over again as people enter and exit.” As a whole, the quiet moments in the sorting office are balanced compositionally by the parcel’s capture of lush color fields, humor and periods of abstraction.</p>


	<p>Displayed for the first time as a photographic installation, the <em>Post Box E3-HS9</em> project also consists of a website on which the journey can be followed, and a publication containing 155 color photographs. The Contemporary Art Society in London launched the book and online project in an event this past January.</p>


	<p>Accompanying the display in the gallery’s main space are three new works from the <em>Postal</em> series in the 6th floor Project Room. Produced in the readymade act of shipping, these pen and ink drawings document the trans-Atlantic travels from his studio en route to the gallery.</p>


	<p>The Horticultural Society of New York will present a concurrent solo exhibition with Knowles April 27 to June 24. Inspired by Italo Calvino’s The Baron in the Trees, the show includes tree drawings and two recent seed dispersal projects, documented in the <span class="caps">NYC</span> urban landscape.</p>

	<p><strong>Biography</strong> 
The creative practice of Tim Knowles (b. 1969, UK) incorporates chance, process and performance into mark making systems. He approaches art as a generative process aligned with the games and experiments of Situationist and Fluxus artists. In his automatic drawings, formal elements are open to mechanisms or phenomena beyond the artist’s control–seeking to reveal the hidden, or otherwise unnoticed motion of objects. These projects capture ephemeral traces: of footsteps in the forest; the full moon’s reflection on undulating water; or intricate movements of a parcel traveling through the postal system. Marked by a romantic take on conceptualism, he travels with torches through the night landscape; affixes sketching pens to tree branches to create a record of their movement. Like a signature, each system reveals the characteristics of an otherwise unnoticed physical experience.</p>


	<p>Recent displays of his work include “for the Baron” at The Horticultural Society of New York; the “Over Yonder” commission in Leeds; “Cimento dell’armonia e dell’invenzione” at the Galerija Gregor Podnar, Berlin; “Fluxus Now” at The Exchange, Penzance, UK; Anti Festival in Kuopio, Finland; and “Mobile Research Station, no.1” at the Skulpturenpark, Berlin. Past exhibitions include the Generali Foundation, Vienna; Economist Plaza, London; M2 Gallery, London; Artissima, Torino; Plymouth Arts Centre, UK; Hayward Gallery, London; Bloomberg Space, London; Hull Time Based Arts, Hull; Gallery Skuc, Ljubljana; Essor Gallery, London; Comune di Codogno, Italy; and Zero, Italy; and bitforms gallery nyc. His work has also been featured in <em>Artforum</em>, <em>Cabinet Magazine</em>,<em>The Independent</em> and <em>The Guardian.</em> Knowles holds awards from South West Arts and the British Council in Rome. He has held residencies at Art Omi in Ghent, NY, the Latvian Academy of Art and the Makrolab [Artscatalyst] Art and Science Research program in Scotland. Knowles studied sculpture at the Bath College of Higher Education and has taught at numerous institutions throughout the UK.</p>
