	<p>Gallery 1</p>


	<p>Lyons Wier Gallery is pleased to announce Dowry by Vadis Turner.</p>


	<p>As handmade objects are passed down through time, they become increasingly precious and culturally relevant. Turner&#8217;s work engages in the transformative legacy of object to heirloom to historical artifact. Ultimately, the work functions as a portrait of the artist, her origins and her time(s).</p>


	<p>Re-imagining traditional handicrafts made by women, Turner has synthesized gender roles and rites of passage to create a series of contemporary heirlooms that illustrate the values of her generation. This body of work comprises her &#8220;Dowry&#8221;, a material and cultural measure of her worth as a woman and as an artist.</p>


	<p>Turner&#8217;s &#8220;Dowry&#8221; includes a site-specific installation, &#8220;Reception&#8221;, that lavishly celebrates and politely ignores the conventions of marriage, specifically consummation.</p>


	<p>Other heirlooms comprising her &#8220;Dowry&#8221; are in the form of Fabergé-like eggs wrapped with human hair, bodily organs constructed with discarded jewelry and s(e)x swings made with antique quilts and a wedding dress.</p>


	<p>Traditionally exchanged for marital advancement, Turner&#8217;s &#8220;Dowry&#8221; will be traded for currency and/or professional gain.</p>


	<p>Gallery 2</p>


	<p>Lyons Wier Gallery is pleased to announce &#8220;Issues with Authority&#8221; by James Rieck.</p>


	<p>All of James Rieck&#8217;s compositions have been inspired by and gleaned from commercial catalogs. Having delved through corporate annual reports, couture fashion catalogs, How-to-Knit and wedding catalogs, he has now turned his focus on the Halloween costume.</p>


	<p>Through amplified scale and severe cropping &#8220;Issues with Authority&#8221; re-contextualizes the source material to draw attention to the obvious as well as the subtle psychological underpinnings of the model and the viewer.</p>


	<p>Rieck delivers an exhibition that simultaneously embraces and dismisses the body politic, and opens a dialogue about physical and mental control, manipulation and what constitutes dominance and subordination.</p>


	<p>Pared down to just slivers, Rieck&#8217;s paintings dominate and titillate the viewer into near arrest. Uncertainty and a sense of implied violence blur the thin blue line, while neither confirming nor condoning part or participant. Both politically and sexually charged, &#8220;Issues with Authority&#8221; addresses obsession and the illusion of power as well as the viewer&#8217;s willingness to surrender to both.</p>


	<p>&#8220;Issues with Authority&#8221;</p>


	<p>Perp: Look! I don&#8217;t want any trouble man… I&#8217;ve got no beef with the fuzz. My issue with authority has nothing to do with the law. It&#8217;s just that these days it seems everybody is their own authority and an expert in everything. It&#8217;s like if you don&#8217;t know something you can just Google it…just look around, people are acting like kings and no one but themselves can see their crown.</p>


	<p>Perp: I got it! I have the right to remain silent, but it seems to me that whenever the cops get involved, violence enters the picture. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s their fault or anything. It&#8217;s just that they have the power to hold people outside of their will, and you know, they have weapons…</p>


	<p>Perp: Okay! I confess… I cropped off their heads, and sliced them in half, then I squeezed them into these slivers, so go ahead and arrest me…but look these woman have power and they&#8217;re not giving in. They&#8217;re larger than life, displayed with dignity &#8211; like they&#8217;re from a catalog of Authority.</p>


	<p>Perp: I know these girls are in police costumes…I know I know, they&#8217;re sexy costumes, but you know…authority is just an illusion and a sexy illusion at that. I mean &#8211; it&#8217;s all about suspending our disbelief…surrender right? Like we want to give in to illusion and be told how to proceed, right?</p>


	<p>Perp: Yeah, they&#8217;re just paintings, I know…I mean, I&#8217;m just saying… If you&#8217;re gonna be busted by 5-0, why not be busted by Charlie&#8217;s Angels?</p>
