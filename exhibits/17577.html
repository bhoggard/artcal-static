  <p>DODGEgallery is pleased to present our summer group exhibition, <em>Size Matters</em>: Rebecca Chamberlain, Ted Gahl, Cassie Raihl, Matt Rich and Michael Zelehoski.</p>


	<p><em>Size Matters</em> is an exhibition with artists who regularly incorporate scale shifts into their practice without changing their material or process. Not many artists adeptly and successfully transition between dramatically different sizes. Whether the material looses impact or the subject changes meaning, the adjustment from small to large or vice versa often fails. The artists selected for this exhibition each habitually oscillate between varying scales, some more dramatically than others, but all with ease. The artists invited to participate have contributed two works each: one large and one small piece relative to the parameters of their own practice.</p>


	<p>Rebecca Chamberlain is presenting her largest and smallest works to date: a five foot high diptych and twelve inch high double-sided plinth. Painting with lithography ink on vintage architecture paper, Chamberlain invokes a wistful timelessness through luminous depictions of interior modernist architecture.</p>


	<p>Ted Gahl is presenting his largest painting ever, a seven foot high acrylic on canvas, and a small work on paper. Gahl has a rigorous, unfettered method of painting. His storyboard-like compositions are filled with his familiar, automatic and idiosyncratic imagery that jostles on the edge of abstraction.</p>


	<p>Cassie Raihl is presenting two sculptures, one torso-sized and one hand-sized, both incorporating stuffed sacks that drape, stand, or balance interdependently with other objects. Raihl assembles seemingly precarious and richly textured forms with both fabricated and found objects, oftentimes obscuring the difference.</p>


	<p>Matt Rich is presenting two wall-hung paper works each representing far-reaching dimensions within his practice. Addressing the materiality of painting, Rich’s textured and free-floating geometric forms are constructed with individuated, and irregularly colored sections that he connects through a process of intentionality and chance.</p>


	<p>Michael Zelehoski is presenting a major work and a tiny work, both wall based pieces. Zelehoski deconstructs weathered utilitarian objects and assembles their parts into dramatic, abstract, two-dimensional compositions that are both object and image at once.</p>
