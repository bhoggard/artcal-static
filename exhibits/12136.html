  <p>Anagnorisis Fine Art and <span class="caps">ISE</span> Cultural Foundatin present, <em>Another Roadside Attraction, An Exploration Into The Modern Art Genre Of The Neo-Grotesque</em>.</p>


	<p>The Neo-Grotesque genre in the fine arts has continued to gain momentum over the past couple of decades with the works of such artists as Odd Nerdrum, Dino Vals, Joel Peter Witkin and Robert and Shana Parke-Harrison, amongst others. Another Roadside Attraction aims to explore this genre by exhibiting a dynamic cross section of artwork that evinces various unique aspects thereof. Seattle’s Roq la Rue gallery states, “The term [Neo-Grotesque] was recently coined for the resurgence of artists working with subject matter traditionally deemed unattractive or repulsive, but representing them in a sympathetic manner in a highly formal technical style.&#8221; More than that, it is a modern exploration of the intriguing “dissonance between the grotesque and the sublime”, to paraphrase author Mark Dery and his essay, The Pyrotechnic Insanitarium. Neo Grotesque artwork not only derives inspiration from history (e.g. the art of Hieronymus Bosch or Roadside Attraction curio exhibits, once ubiquitous in the United States), but also more modern influences due to the proliferation of the internet. Often cathartic in nature, it unburies uncomfortable and/or strange truths, old and new, inherent in the world around us.</p>


	<p>Another Roadside Attraction, an unprecedented cabinet of curiosities, is a place where tourists stop en route to other destinations, enticed by the lure of the exotic unknown. Be sure not to pass us by!</p>


	<p>Artists on view:</p>


	<p>Dan Estabrook, Christian Rex van Minnen, Julie Anne Mann, Carrie Ann Baade, Christopher Conte, Heather Gargon, Alex Passapera, Caitlin Hackett, Samantha Levin and Danielle Ezzo</p>


	<p>In conjunction with this exhibit, there will also be a lecture and talk on the grotesque in art by Dr. Nancy Hightower, professor of the Grotesque in Art and Literature at the University of Colorado taking place on a separate date: Saturday, November 20, 6-8pm.</p>


	<p>Another Roadside Attraction will be generously funded by a grant from the Ise Cultural Foundation as part of their Program for Emerging Curators series which they have focused on since 2002.  The <span class="caps">PEC</span> gives emerging curators an opportunity to organize their exhibition in their 2000 sq. foot gallery space in SoHo in Manhattan. <span class="caps">PEC</span> is an open call program for curators all over the world and has included more than 30 <span class="caps">PEC</span> exhibitions successfully. Their consistent effort to provide an experimental and alternative venue for curators and artists has been recognized by many great publications including the New York Times, the New Yorker, Art in America, TimeOut NY, Village <span class="caps">VOICE</span>, and many others.</p>


	<p>Anagnorisis Fine Arts is a young fine arts organization that represents and exhibits extraordinary emerging and established artists of the New Contemporary (aka Pop Surreal) genre. Each artist has a penchant for creating very lush artwork, uplifting or uncomfortable, subversive or sublime. Exhibiting mainly at the White Rabbit Lounge in New York City, Anagnorisis also works frequently with other galleries and alternative spaces to introduce new visual language to art collectors and lovers alike.</p>
