  <p>The 22 Magazine is pleased to present an evening of music, art, food, and puppetry with Andru Bemis, Anna Gevalt, Elizabeth Laprelle, and Katherine Fahey. They will collectively present a evening of collaborative traditional ballad, fiddle, and banjo music. Anna, Elizabeth, and Katherine will also be presenting a cranky. A cranky is a hand-cranked scrolling device, illustrating a story or song. They will be joined by puppeteer Daniel Patrick Fay, and visual artists Jimmy McBride, Megan Canning, Eileen Hoffman, Reineke Hollander, and more. The event will take place on April 26, at Vaudeville Park in Brooklyn. Preceding the show there will be a shadow puppet workshop and square dancing lessons with Anna and Elizabeth.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">BIOS</span>:</p>


	<p><span class="caps">ANDRU BEMIS</span>: Since 2001, Andru Bemis has wandered the ends, edges and in-betweens of North America more times than he can count-by passenger train, foot, thumb, bicycle, bus, subway, ski and occasional aeroplane. Wearing a three-piece suit and a derby hat, he carries his beat-up instruments on his back: banjo, guitar, sometimes a fiddle or banjo ukulele&#8230;. Call him a “Folk” musician if you will. Bemis plays music for folks, simple as that. His unmistakable voice, lightning-fast banjo and expressive finger-picked guitar styles, quirky humor, engaging stage presence and exquisitely crafted tunes of travel, love and longing have earned Bemis a dedicated following throughout Mexico, Canada, the U.S. and beyond.

	<p><span class="caps">KATHERINE FAHEY</span>: Baltimore artist Katherine Fahey is a shadow puppeteer, singer, and printmaker, whose recent collaborations have brought shadow puppetry to the independent music scene, most notably her music video for Wye Oak.

	<p><span class="caps">REINEKE HOLLANDER</span>: Reineke Hollander was born in Rotterdam,The Netherlands.The timing of her birth, right after the end of World War II, has greatly influenced her art. The barrage of images and stories of interrupted lives made her focus, allegorically, on ‘things lost, or thrown away’. Another significant influence was traveling through Africa, where she found that the necessary improvisational quality of life, to use and reuse everything in imaginative ways, often leads to aesthetic qualities that manage to look ‘just right’. So, ‘what is lost, or thrown away and what you can do with it’ became the main source of her imagination and the practice of her work, which includes painting and sewing. Hollander’s work is included in numerous public and private collections in the Netherlands, Great-Britain, France, Germany, Israel and the United States. She lives and works mostly in New York City since 1987.

	<p><span class="caps">ABOUT THE 22</span>: 
Since late 2010, The 22 Magazine has been committed to presenting beautiful and thoughtful portrayals of artists, writers, musicians and the creative community with an emphasis on the creator and their work. Based in Brooklyn, The 22 is an online magazine that seeks to utilize the internet as a curatorial realm that is free from physical and some momentary restrictions. While a print version will be available shortly, the focus remains the digital realm and the dedication to presenting new, under represented works alongside more established pieces in a democratic manner. We seek structures that play off each other, enhance the whole, and seek to present work as a means of creative communication with other disciplines, creators and communities. Our credo is and remains,“strength in numbers.” It is this manner we create not only the magazine but our events, with careful consideration and research of our participants, and an eye on supporting the creative community as often and as much as we can.
