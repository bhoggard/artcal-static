  <p>Organized by Tom Weinrich</p>


	<p>Interstate Projects is pleased to present The Black Lodge, an exhibition of work by nine artists. In the darker regions of the mythology in David Lynch’s seminal television series Twin Peaks, there exists a place referred to as the Black Lodge. It is a space of spiritual and psychological transformation. A surreal environment where visitors confront their doppelganger, lose their understanding of space and time, emerging as a pure being or staying trapped in a maze of red curtains, giants, and non-sequiturs.</p>


	<p>Eschewing any direct references to its namesake, this exhibition examines Lynch’s representation of a vision quest, along with his portrayal of women and use of patterning and repetition as a base upon which to consider the art being made by nine very different artists. Articulated across a wide range of mediums; from darkly humorous video installations, poetic abstractions made with pencil or video, and deeply personal figurative paintings and photographs, the works gathered reflect on the varied experiences that can lead to a better understanding of life and death, and all that lies in between.</p>
