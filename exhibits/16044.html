  <p>Cheryl McGinnis Gallery is delighted to be in their new location, a charming ground floor space in Tribeca. Much like their Madison Avenue location and the Upper West Side Salon before that, this space affords the gallery the opportunity to exhibit work in an apartment-like atmosphere open to the public</p>


	<p>Hindsight:Foresight is a look at the gallery’s future, those artists who will have exhibits in 2012 with the gallery or with Cheryl McGinnis Projects, a curatorial division, by way of looking at the past; seminal works that are important to the history of each artist. In this exhibit:</p>


	<p>Hu Bing’s “Collison Course,” which originated within the exhibit “Sca&#8221;ered Petal, Fallen Leaves, Shards of Glass” at the Brooklyn Museum, travelled to the Neuberger and Islip Museums. The next large iteration of this installation will be seen at the Flatiron Prow Art Space, March 1-May31, 2012. For this exhibit a smaller piece will be installed.</p>


	<p>Zhang Hongtu’s bronze work “Mai Dang Lao,” which one can find in the Princeton Museum of Art, will exhibit here. As well, we will exhibit the “Christie Cataloge Pages,” which were exhibited in “Translucent, Transparent, Tranported” on Madison Avenue. Zhang Hongtu’s new work was recently exhibited in “Intermediate.” at Sarnoff Museum, The College of New Jersey.</p>


	<p>As Song Xin prepares for the opening of her <span class="caps">MTA</span> subway installation, we take a look at a piece from her “Four Seasons,” which exhibited at the Madison Avenue location in “Through Women’s Eyes.”</p>


	<p>For Wei Jia we will exhibit several new pieces on paper. Wei Jia recently had exhibits at the Colorado Museum of Art, The Chelsea Museum of Art and his work will be seen in Tenri Cultural Institute in May.</p>


	<p>Lin Yan will exhibit her monumental piece from, “Transforming the Mark,” Dresden Museum on Art, as well as new work. Her work is also included in Richard Vine’s new book “New China.New Art”She will have an exhibit at Tenri Cultural Institute as well as a solo exhibition with this gallery.</p>


	<p>Rebecca Riley continues her exploration of maps. In the past she has drawn on singal map surfaces. For this exhibit, her work is a compilation of many surfaces collaged together and connected through a new element, waterways. Rebecca will exhibit the work in full in a large installation at the Flatiron Prow Art Space in June 2012.</p>


	<p>Laura McCallum’s intricate paper work was last seen in “Reconstructing Paper,” in our interim space on 38th Street as well, her video work is currently on exhibit in “The Value of Water,”at St. John the Divine. We are thrilled to have new pieces.</p>


	<p>Nina Kuo’s recently exhibited work in “Le Deluge-apres Mao,” curated by Dr. Patricia Karetzky at the Cress Gallery at the University of Tennesse. Her digital work was first exhibited on Madison Avenue in Chanel Chinosserie. For this exhibit, we will show several new pieces</p>
