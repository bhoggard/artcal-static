<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Frederieke Taylor Gallery is pleased to announce an exhibition entitled <em><span class="caps">ADHESION</span></em>, a visual installation by artist Federico Diaz, to open September 15th. This is the first solo show in New York of Federico Díaz, one of the most important artists of a new generation of international creative talent today.</p>


	<p>Since the mid-1990s, Federico Diaz has been producing consistently innovative and engaging work through experimentation with new media. His vision encompasses the rudimentary and the refined, a combination that infuses his work with particular emotional force. Díaz explores ideas drawn from biogenetics and cosmogony and seeks to create a link between the two. As such, his work sets in motion a continual reformulation of the relationship between man and the universe. His installations and projects are very often interactive: the spectator not only becomes part of the work of art, but influences it by the form, appearance and movement of his or her body.</p>


	<p>Alanna Heiss remarks in her introduction to Federico Diaz’s recently published artist monograph:</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>With roots in Eastern Europe and South America, Diaz’s interest in futurism and modernism stems from two continents. His practice encompasses the Utopian attitudes of the 1960s as well as the advanced materials of this century. He is truly an artist more than an architect and his work is closer to landscape and earth art than it is to installation.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>For <em><span class="caps">ADHESION</span></em>, which Diaz views as a Survival Manual for Humankind, the works focus on the primary principles of life: vibration and resonance. In this exhibition, he will create a series of specially designed thermo-sensitive panels and bio-morphic objects visually referencing natural and urban environments. The objects will manifest a transfer of vibrations creating a very slow movement, almost imperceptibly, due to micro temperature changes in printed circuits covered by thermo-paint in these unique panels.</p>


	<blockquote>
		<p>Díaz considers architecture a complex discipline that nonetheless emanates from sculpture, adding that “architecture is basically sculpture with more active sociology.” Like many artists exploring new dimensions before him in the Renaissance during the 14th and 15th centuries, his work often blurs the differences between art and science.</p>
	</blockquote>


	<p>–Robert T. Buck</p>


	<p>Federico Diaz is based in Prague and has created installations and exhibitions in public spaces including the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, <span class="caps">ZKM</span> in Karlsruhe, Germany, numerous exhibitions in the Czech Republic, Japan, and most recently in the United States where he created <span class="caps">ULTRA</span>, a public space and pavilion for <span class="caps">PS1</span>&#8217;s annual radio broadcast from Art Basel Miami Beach 2008. He will create an installation at MassMOCA in Spring 2010.</p>
