  <p>Artists: Amy Chan, Ming Fay, Jung Hyang Kim, and Hyungsub Shin. 
Curated by Eun Young Choi</p>


	<p>In collaboration with the <strong>Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center</strong>, <strong>Asian American Arts Centre</strong> presents an exhibition entitled, “Boom Box”. Located on <span class="caps">CSV</span> 2ed floor and  installed in the Abrazo Interno Gallery, it will be open to the public for viewing 7 days a week from 3:30pm to 7pm, and by appointment.  From March 16 Wednesday to March 30 Wednesday, the public is welcome to this beautiful gallery. Curated by Eun Young Choi, the exhibition features four artists: Jung Hyang Kim, Ming Fay, Amy Chan, and Hyungsub Shin. The white walled rectangular gallery with its high ceiling will be transformed into a vibrant celebration of colorful blooms, pods, branches, and burgeoning flora.</p>


	<p>The exhibition includes intricate multi-layered dreamlike abstractions of Jung Hyang Kim, a fruit-laden lush urban jungle installation by Ming Fay, delicate yet quietly mesmerizing surreal landscapes by Amy Chan, and beautiful blooms created from traditional hand-held fansthat straddle the boarder between nature and artificiality by Hyungsub Shin.  They each create beautiful visual harmony inspired by nature’s Boom Box. Like the compact portable stereo, the exhibition overflows with various rhythms and melodies that combine together to create a complex yet intimate visual symphony.</p>


	<p>This exhibition of two Artists from <span class="caps">AAAC</span>’s digital archive – artasiamerica.org &#8211; and two artists unknown to this archive, all chosen by Eun Young Choi, brings to life a relationship between artists and the public, such that a context builds, and a greater appreciation and understanding accumulates.  With a new generation a relationship can be found to those who have come before and this brings a wholly different perspective to the contemporary art field.  Creative individuals can still be appreciated as individuals, but they can also be seen as innovators to a tradition, to a past that continues to be active in the present. And the archive – both the original physical archive of Asian American artists and the digital archive, enables a more extensive view and background of the breadth of this relationship.</p>


	<p>Eun Young Choi is an artist and curator based in Brooklyn. She has an <span class="caps">MFA</span> from the School of Visual Arts and studied Museum Studies at City College, <span class="caps">CUNY</span>.

She has also exhibited her work international in Spain, Germany, United Kingdom, Japan, Korea, and the US.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">AAAC</span> and <span class="caps">CSV</span> welcome student groups, educators and general public to the Abrazo Interno Gallery in their visit to the Lower East Side.  <span class="caps">AAAC</span> staff will be available to give gallery tours and answer questions from the public, as well as the press.
