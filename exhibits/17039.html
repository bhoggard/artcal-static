	<p>Exhibition Dates: May 10 &#8211; July 8, 2012

	<p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to announce the <span class="caps">EDITIONS</span> ‘12: <span class="caps">EXHIBITION OPENING AND CATALOGUE LAUNCH</span> on Thursday, May 10. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from May 10 – July 8, 2012. With a catalogue essay by Roberta Waddell, a renowned print expert and former Curator of Prints at the New York Public Library, the catalogue and exhibition feature new works created by recipients of the Printshop’s Special Editions and Publishing Residencies: Hong Seon Jang, Jennie C. Jones, Darina Karpov, and David Kramer, and Enoc Perez.</p>


	<p>The Special Editions Residency provides emerging artists with an opportunity to create a major new body of work in collaboration with Master Printers Erik Hougen and James Miller, fully sponsored by the Printshop. Hong Seon Jang, Jennie C. Jones, Darina Karpov, and David Kramer have all immersed themselves in printmaking for several months, exploring new materials and techniques that have broadened their practice. What followed were outstanding projects of conceptual and technical expertise that showcase the artists’ most ambitious print projects to date.</p>


	<p>Enoc Perez created the Lever House suite through the Printshop’s exclusive Publishing Residency Program, also working with Dusica Kirjakovic, Erik Hougen, and James Miller. Continuing his exploration of modernist buildings and their architectural allure, both symbolically and aesthetically, Perez has revisited the distinguished New York City Lever House building as subject. Ultimately, these prints offer both a bold point of view and a sense of effortless completion.</p>


	<p>The Printshop&#8217;s residency programs offer opportunities to artists of all career stages to use professional facilities and collaborate with talented printers who approach each artist’s vision with great care and skill.</p>
