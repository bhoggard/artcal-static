	<p>Allegra LaViola Gallery is pleased to present Draw the Line, an exhibition of drawing, installation and painting that 
explores the theme of the line in art.</p>


	<p>In his essay “The Role of Line in Art” Wyndham Lewis speaks of the line as “the bone beneath the pulp”.  This idea of 
the essential structure underlying the construction of a work is the starting point for Draw the Line.  While Lewis was 
speaking specifically of drawing, this exhibition seeks to explore the line in a broader context.</p>


	<p><strong>Marci MacGuffie</strong>’s site-specific installation takes its inspiration from bars and cells.  The lines that constrain can also 
harbor a plethora of worlds within them, existing on the macro and micro levels.  <strong>Don Gummer</strong>’s collages cut layers of 
line that rest over a sparkling setting, evincing a sense of the sculptural despite their attachment to paper.</p>


	<p><strong>Lauren Seiden</strong>’s delicate markings pull us closer as we seek to find the paths laid out in her monochromatic drawings 
that float as if suspended in time and space.  Each line feels as fleeting as light, but yet has an arresting permanence.  
<strong>Warren Isensee</strong> also relies on a modest amount of space to communicate a large amount of information.  His perfectly 
rendered lines bend around themselves to create totems and rhythms of space.</p>


	<p>Playful blasts of color illuminate both the work of <strong>Gary Petersen</strong> and <strong>Margaret Lanzetta</strong>, sending neon flashes out as 
if warning of unstable and easily changeable surfaces.  Bright colors also illuminate the work of <strong>Marina Adams</strong>, whose 
swirling parachute of paint is contained in a square, but seems to swirl beyond the canvas.  Also leaping out of the 
frame is <strong>Stephen Westfall</strong>, whose optical stripes jump with precise coordination.  Both <strong>Almond Zigmund</strong> and the 
graffiti artist <strong>Depoe</strong> have literally escaped the bounds of the canvas and created installation wall paintings that use the 
gallery’s architecture to explore the limits of the line and our perception when surrounded by an engineered 
environment.</p>


	<p><strong>Sandi Slone</strong>’s tondos are a surprise: the lines cut across them like broad roads or sashes with an aggressive intensity 
that belies their beauty.  <strong>Joey Archuleta</strong> build a new type of surface on his panels- ripping, sewing and marking the 
canvas covering like he is rebuilding the painting after a war.  An assault on the work is also present in <strong>Samuel T. 
Adams</strong>’ paintings: the works have been bleached and stained so that the frame is visible from the front, seeming like a 
ghost window and reminding us of the materiality of the pieces.  <strong>Field Kallop</strong> also builds to destroy- her work is cut up 
and sewn back together, creating an interruption in the delicate galaxy that spins out from the fabric.</p>


	<p><strong>Jennifer Riley</strong> and <strong>Greg Hopkins</strong> both address the idea of hidden surfaces- patterns reveal hidden colors and buried 
loops within their canvases, producing a many layered surface while remaining entirely flat. The surface is also of 
interest to <strong>Chuck Webster</strong>, whose use of antique book leaves for his watercolors lends a gravity that comes with the 
combination of painting and lettering.  The watercolors of <strong>Erik Jeor</strong> have a similar tension between light and darkness- 
the lines of his ink are allowed to pool before being called back into strict submission.</p>


	<p>The use of line is as basic a tool as an artist has at hand, and whether breaking free of the grid or embracing the 
confinement of the axis the line remains at the beginning and the end of composition.</p>
