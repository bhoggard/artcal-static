  <p>jean-baptiste bernadet &#38; patrick brennan: dirty windows
december 20, 2012 – january 27, 2013 / reception for the artists: wednesday, december 19 / 6-8pm</p>


	<p>jean-baptiste bernadet &#38; patrick brennan present a series of recent paintings on canvas. viewing these works is like trying to see the sun through a dirty window &#8211; they distort and warp your gaze. both artists work in layers &#8211; finally utilizing a coat of pearly acrylic and glass beads which awaken fragmented forms and illuminate a rich and tactile palette.</p>


	<p>given the task of defining this shared visual code both artists and the gallery produced a ten word description of the exhibition:
gallery: shine / distraction / barrier / touch / dual / transmit / noise / sublime / vibrate / muffle
bernadet: dawn / anthems / transfer / translate / transient / transparent / someone / words / gradient / dawn
brennan: glare / slice / gold / high / flake / black / camouflage / wonder / eclipse / fold</p>


	<p>the gallery also asked both artists a series a questions:</p>


	<p>where are you from / where’s your studio?   
j-bb: Paris / Dumbo, Triangle Residency 
pb: Syracuse, New York  / Brooklyn</p>


	<p>what is your medium? 
j-bb &#38; pb: Painting</p>


	<p>what do you use most often in your studio?
j-bb: The couch. Reading newspaper, listening to music, napping sometimes, and always feeling guilty of not finding ways to spend more time on paintings. I don&#8217;t need more than one or two hours a day for work, but for this hour to happen I need to loose the seven or eight hours around to find it.
pb: My imagination.</p>


	<p>what is your favorite part of the creative process?
j-bb: Buying some materials is a joyful moment, and also maybe the deep, intense satisfaction I can get when I&#8217;m happy of what I’ve done and other people agree with me. It happens three or four times a year, but it’s worth all the other painful and lonely moments.
pb: I love everything about it. It&#8217;s what drives the work. The chance to get into the studio and do what I want, the way I want is enthralling!</p>


	<p>what is your earliest memory of art?  
j-bb: I am lucky enough, thanks to my parents, for not being able to answer that. I spent so much time as a kid learning to play viola, piano, visiting museums and flea markets, reading books etc.
pb: A painting of Napoleon in a text book in 2nd grade. It moved me. That feeling comes and gos but at the time it was so real.</p>


	<p>how did you start working in your current medium?
j-bb: Just before entering art school, I was 18 probably. Before that I wanted to be clown, a tv host, then a fireworks engineer, an industrial designer, a writer, a cook.
pb: I was making video and I needed to get back to making objects. In my mind I wanted to make sculpture but they turn out to be collage really. But I call them paintings.</p>


	<p>what was the last exhibition you saw?
j-bb: The Rineke Dikjstra show at the Guggenheim is not the last I saw but it was the last I loved. I&#8217;m really suspicious about the ideas of morale, honesty and sincerity in art, but she&#8217;s among the very few artists that makes me believe in these things. I also loved the small Vuillard show at the Jewish museum, he’s one of my favorite artist.
pb: Jay Defeo at <span class="caps">SFMOMA</span>. Mind blowing!!</p>


	<p>is there an artist you’ve always wanted to grab drinks with?
j-bb: Recently, all the artists I really wanted to meet but didn&#8217;t even try to because they are too famous or unreachable, died few months after I started thinking of finding a way to meet them &#8211; so I won’t name the other ones, still alive, here.
And if I could have a drink with a dead one it would be Marcel Proust.
pb: Julian Shnabel .. Would be interesting. Right?
if money was no object, what artwork would you acquire?
j-bb: I&#8217;m doing a lot of trades with other artists, and I&#8217;m happy with that. I&#8217;m not really a collector. I guess I would rather buy a liveable, useful artwork, like a house, le Cabanon of Le Corbusier, or the Eileen Gray’s E-1027 house, both in Roquebrune Cap-Martin.
pb: I want a Mattisse cut out painting.</p>


	<p>is there one thing you wish you could do? 
j-bb: Write books. And get my driving license.
pb: Acquire a Mattisse cut out painting! (laugh)</p>
