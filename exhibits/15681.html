  <p>Downtown contemporary art gallery Klughaus Gallery is proud to announce its grand opening and inaugural exhibition, “Home for the Holidays,” on December 9, 2011.

	<p>Klughaus Gallery will celebrate its inaugural show on December 9, 2011 with a reception from 6:00pm-10:00pm. All are welcomed to attend the reception and may <span class="caps">RSVP</span> by emailing <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="98eaebeee8d8f3f4edfff0f9edebb6f6fdecb6">[email&#160;protected]</a></p>


	<p>The gallery plans to hold future monthly shows featuring an international group of work with established names, as well as emerging artists. For more information about the gallery and the opening, please visit <a href="http://www.klughaus.net">http://www.klughaus.net</a>.</p>


	<p>About the Artists</p>


	<p>Faust was raised on the mean streets of New York where crime was a way of life. He found solace and success in writing his name on other people&#8217;s sh*t. From vagabond to vanguard, his career was forged from the writing on the walls.  Faust was recently featured in the November issue of Paper magazine as an upcoming New York artist to look out for.</p>


	<p>Fuzz One is considered one of the greatest <span class="caps">IRT</span> (subway) graffiti legends of all time.  Fuzz started writing when he moved to the Bronx in 1970.  That is where he met the original pioneers of the graffiti art form and learned how to ride the rails with the best and most influential writers of the generation.  He continued to paint with many of the top crews in the city through the 90’s.</p>


	<p>Greg Lamarche is a native New Yorker who is well known for his detail oriented collage work that he’s been making for almost 30 years.  Before his work in commercial galleries, Lamarche was already well known and respected as a graffiti writer throughout the 80’s and 90’s.  The energy from his outlaw work in the streets is still evident in his work to this day.</p>


	<p>Kimou ‘Grotesk’ Meyer is a Swiss born and Belgian trained graphic designer who moved to New York City in 1999.  His style is simple, fun and definitely his own.  He excelled in tee shirt and apparel design and worked with many key brands responsible for the downtown scene’s commercial success over the last decade.</p>


	<p>Mr. Kiji was born on the Island of Kyushu in the town of Beppu, Japan and raised in New York City. Kiji&#8217;s formal art education began with an apprenticeship in the Tibetan Buddhist Thangka painting. He graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design with a Degree in Industrial Design in 2003. After several years working inhouse at various creative studios as a designer, Kiji now focuses on his primary passion of drawing professionally though a variety of commercial illustration and graphic art projects. (<a href="http://www.mrkiji.com">http://www.mrkiji.com</a>)</p>


	<p>For Michael Alan, art is a combination of harmonious opposites, close observation, catharsis, a means of communication and a radical juxtaposition of dimensional elements. He challenges everything: concepts of figure, composition, media and movement, including his own. Exploring the ambiguity of time and history, Alan’s work focuses on crossbreeding and the relationship of destruction and creation.

	<p>Tom Gould is a New Zealand born photographer based in New York City.  His interest for photography began as a teenager, documenting acts of mischief along the railway corridor.  His love for the streets and his immediate environment led him to New York to continue capturing aspects of life and society that are often overlooked and ignored.  As a photographer he is dedicated to capturing the beauty in the most unsuspecting of scenes and situations.</p>


	<p>Veefer is a name well known in the streets of New York City over the last few decades.  He is considered to be one of the most consistent and well respected street bombers of all time.  While most people are familiar with his outlaw work in the streets, few are aware of his talent when it comes to his fine art paintings.  Veefer will definitely be a gallery name to look out for in the near future.</p>


	<p>About Klughaus Gallery 
Klughaus Gallery works primarily with artists that have roots in graffiti/underground culture.  The gallery exhibits a variety of fine art works that are reasonably priced for everyone from the general public to serious collectors. In addition, the gallery offers an extensive portfolio of aerosol artists for commissioned work. Most importantly, we vow to protect the identity of those artists that work with us who wish to remain anonymous. Klughaus Gallery seeks to develop itself as a leader in fostering art appreciation within the local (Chinatown/LES) community.</p>


	<p>Klughaus Gallery is located at 47 Monroe St. New York, <span class="caps">NY 10002</span>.
“Home for the Holidays” will be on display from December 9, 2011 to December 31, 2011.</p>
