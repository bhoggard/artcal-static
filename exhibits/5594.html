<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>In the heart of Greenwich Village there exists a psychoanalytic training institute renowned for its innovative development in psychoanalytic theory and practice. Since 1971 we have been training psychoanalysts and with an Absolute Charter from the State of New York granting a Certificate in Psychoanalysis as well as providing low cost treatment. Over these decades, we have seen how analytic training and psychoanalytic treatment can be enlightening and transforming as we begin to experience life more fully and uncover our own specific and individual forms of creativity. For clinicians, <span class="caps">CMPS</span> opens new doors in understanding the underpinnings of emotional disorders while offering a unique and comprehensive approach to psychoanalytic technique.</p>


	<p>about &#8220;Presence&#8221;</p>


	<p>The first in our new series of art exhibitions and screenings, this show will explore the sense of psychic presence in art.  It was curated by internationally recognized artist Kenneth Feingold, who writes about the concept of the show, &#8220;The human figure, in one way or another, has been a focus of art from its beginnings; but rather than examining the figure itself, here we look to focus attention on the ways in which the artists&#8217; representations evoke familiar aspects of the interiority of the person and are able to evoke certain affective responses in the viewer.  In particular, this group of works produces feelings in me that might be described as disquiet, a form of anxiety along the boundary of absence/presence, as if a sense of the presence of something which is absent or the absence of something which is present. &#8220;</p>


	<p>&#8220;Presence&#8221; will include more than forty works by fifteen artists in a wide variety of media, including painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography.</p>


	<p>about the artists</p>


	<p><span class="caps">ANDREA COTE</span> writes about her work: &#8221; `Faces&#8217; explores the fine line between sanity and madness, both literally and metaphorically. The series began in 1998, when I photographed myself during an episode of manic psychosis. I sandwiched the images together, creating portraits that reveal the conflicting emotions erupting just beneath the surface. I retain the scratches that show the physicality and wear of the images over time, much like our bodies carry the marks of our experiences. Dark mirrors of the personal and universal, these portraits reveal the human capacity for terror, fear, jealousy, confusion, and desire within every one of us. <a href="http://andreaspace.net/">http://andreaspace.net/</a></p>

	<p><span class="caps">CRISTINA FONTSAR</span> lives and works in Barcelona, where she  studied Fine Arts and Landscape Architecture.  She writes, &#8221; From the beginning of my work the major theme has been space &#8211; space as a place for activities and games. I found that I am not interested in sculpture as an object that looks at itself, but rather, as an element in a public space that creates an aesthetic, social, and functional situation. In that situation, the viewer has an important role in the work. And so, by interacting with real public space, my interest in landscape design was born. The next extension from there was photography. By using photography as a tool to approach and analyze landscape I have realized that this medium allowed me a more emotional an intimate relationship with my work and therefore with the viewer.&#8221;  She exhibited widedly in Spain and has realized many projects in public spaces.

	<p><span class="caps">MIYUKI TSUSHIMA</span> grew up in Tokyo, where economic advancement held the highest priority. At the age of 15, she was told to drop the idea of being an artist until she retired from a successful business career or married into wealth. Partially following this advice, she studied political science and became a journalist, then studied environmental economics at Harvard University. However, a weekend Greyhound bus trip from Boston to New York City convinced her to drop all classes in economics and to begin a second life as an artist in New York City. Born prematurely into her new life, the Aaron Siskind Foundation aided her survival. She received an <span class="caps">MFA</span> from School of Visual Arts in 2003.   About her work, she writes, &#8220;If you are an animal you will be hunted down. I tell the ongoing tale of three imaginary creatures, a radioactive evil flying squirrel, a caveperson, and a headless bear, who must learn to survive in this city. Scumbled white backgrounds depict their lost habitat, perhaps of rocks or snow. While humorous at times, the prevailing effect is melancholy alienation. Their plight reflects that of animals today, of the earth itself, and even my situation as a foreigner, immigrant, or resident `alien&#8217;.&#8221;
