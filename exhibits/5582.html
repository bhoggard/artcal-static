<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>On the heels of the summer&#8217;s popular Source Code exhibition, Eyebeam is pleased to present Interference, the second in a series of three group shows commemorating the organization&#8217;s unique role in supporting artists experimenting with, and critically examining, the impact of new technologies in creative endeavor.</p>


	<p>The show will feature eleven artists and collectives whose projects tackle the ever-shifting boundaries between public and private space and consider the ways in which these limits are understood, utilized and represented. Employing a diverse array of media and strategies including data visualization, performance, community engagement and intervention, the artists address issues of autonomy and access, in some cases becoming actors within the very environments they describe. All current or past Eyebeam artists, residents and fellows, the artists featured in Interference are: Angie Eng, Jill Magid, Forays (Geraldine Juarez and Adam Bobbette), Carrie Dashow and Jesse Pearlman Karlsberg, Trevor Paglen and the Institute for Applied Autonomy (IAA), Robert Ransick, Yury Gitman, Carlos Gomez de LLarena, Graffiti Research Lab (GRL), Caspar Stracke, neuroTransmitter, and Eyebeam&#8217;s R&#38;D Lab with Jonah Peretti and Michael Frumin.</p>


	<p>The opening reception will be followed by a live VJ performance as collective montage by Angie Eng, Benton-C Bainbridge and Caspar Stracke.</p>


	<p>In the Eyebeam spirit of open source and <span class="caps">DIY</span>, the gallery exhibition will be supplemented by workshops, public actions and interventions for the duration of Interference, including live demonstrations and tours with the show&#8217;s mobile pieces: Carlos Gomez de Llarena&#8217;s interactive communication balloon, Urballoon (2002-2004) <span class="caps">GRL</span>&#8217;s Laser-Tag equipped Mobile Broadcast Unit (2007) and Yury Gitman&#8217;s wifi-delivery vehicle Magic Bike (2003).</p>


	<p>The concurrence of surveillance, authority, intimacy and trust are at the heart of Jill Magid&#8217;s Lincoln Ocean Victor Eddy (2006-2007), a multi-part account of 5 months spent shadowing a <span class="caps">NYC</span> police officer on his night shift. For Interference, Magid will display L.O.V.E work as an audio and video installation.</p>


	<p>Urban Attractors, Private Distractors (2007), Angie Eng&#8217;s collaborative, cross-continent video blog takes as its subject cultural conventions in the definition of private and public space. Together with groups of teens in New York City and Ho Chi Minh City, Eng probed the psychogeographies of place through a series of actions documented and shared on the video blog.</p>


	<p>Forays&#8217; (Geraldine Juarez and Adam Bobbette) piece entitled Field Notes&#8230;(2007), addresses the ways in which the delineation of interior and exterior or private and public space can be used towards political ends. Turning to the naturally occurring form of the cocoon, which has been adapted by community garden activists as a means of colonizing trees, the artists propose open source architecture and hacked materials as forms of grassroots activism.</p>


	<p>Caspar Stracke, who as a 2003 Eyebeam Resident developed the work Points of Presence (2005) &#8211; a rotating screen projection of footage from <span class="caps">NYC</span>, Mexico City, Berlin and Shanghai &#8211; now presents Urban Particle Supercollider (2007), a collective urban image project shown as three linked animations of street objects from Seoul, Tehran and <span class="caps">NYC</span>.</p>


	<p>Artist and geographer Trevor Paglen, who received a 2006 Eyebeam Production Commission, partnered with the <span class="caps">IAA</span>, an anonymous collective of artists, designers, activists and engineers, to develop Terminal Air (2007) a project that explores complex interconnections between government agencies and private contractors involved with the United States Central Intelligence Agency&#8217;s extraordinary rendition program.</p>


	<p>Robert Ransick&#8217;s Casa Segura (Safe House) (2007) is a small public access structure in the Sonoran desert of Southern Arizona, just north of the Mexican border. Located on private property and equipped with a dynamic bilingual web space Casa Segura acts as a temporary haven to Mexican migrants crossing the border, providing a means of communicating across national and state lines by logging their journeys in virtual space.</p>


	<p>Artist Carrie Dashow and shape note singer Jesse Pearlman Karlsberg present The 13th Screen (2007) an installation of community-shot video, original shape note songs and ephemera from the Route of Progress tour, part of the touring community art, video, and music project, the Subliminal History of New York State (SHNYS) (2007), which traveled to six towns and cities along the Erie Canal this past June and July.</p>


	<p>Also on display will be documentation of neuroTransmitter&#8217;s The FM Ferry Experiment (2007) a mobile radio station aboard the Staten Island Ferry during September, as well as FundRace, which lets you track people&#8217;s political contributions by name, address or neighborhood. The interactive web application will be shown in its original (2004) and current iterations, and is a project developed by Jonah Peretti, Michael Frumin and Eyebeam&#8217;s Research and Development Lab. FundRace 2008 was updated by and is hosted at Huffington Post.</p>
