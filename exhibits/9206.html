	<p>Ekundayo was born in Honolulu, HI, but spent most of his childhood moving from place to place with his father, living a life on the run. At the age of 13 Ekundayo discovered one of his uncle’s black books, which completely changed his life. Ekundayo became obsessed with drawing and copied every single page of that little book.</p>


	<p>Ekundayo combines both subversive graffiti aesthetics in combination with art-historical erudition using acrylic, gouache, watercolor, ink and various carving techniques. Ekundayo’s work expresses the struggle of life and how those struggles and burdens can either inspire us to change in a constructive way or weigh us down by our own inability to change.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">JOSHUA CLAY BIO</span></p>


	<p>Joshua Clay was always destined to become an artist, choosing pencil and paper over toys and technology. Throughout his high school years Clay found himself consumed by the act of painting creating over fifty original works and several large scale murals. Following college Joshua relocated to Los Angeles where he apprenticed under artist Blaine Fontana. In under 2 years of living and working as a fulltime fine artist Clay found himself immersed in the emerging Los Angeles new contemporary art movement.</p>


	<p>With four successful solo exhibits and dozens of group exhibits under his belt, Clay has been busy making quite a name for himself. In addition to having his work featured in several books and magazines in recent years, Clay has also caught the attention of the music industry creating artwork for bands including Nine Inch Nails, Linkin Park, Gym Class Heroes and Fall Out Boy. Joshua Clay is sure to be a name you’ll be seeing again.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">THEDIRTYFABULOUS BIO</span></p>


	<p>TheDirtyFabulous was born in the year of the Dragon and travels the windblown highway of Interstate 40.</p>


	<p>This body of work actually began in 1997 – in a small, run-down house on some wooded land. The place has since been deserted. Working in that place helped bring into focus the narratives I would continue to work with. Over the years, the work has been slowly accumulating. I see this as an ongoing project – a book of fables, with large paper drawings as pages. These drawings have no set sequence of images or reading. The word fable is derived from the Latin word fabula, meaning “story”. I repeatedly explore themes such as myth, psychology, philosophy, apparition of beauty, eroticism, machines of fate, human folly, nostalgia, mortality, history, consumer culture, industrialization, loss and regret. Imagery is used from many sources and typically a work is generated in response to readings or in reference to life experiences. I use nineteenth century mechanical relics, sequences from dreams, vintage pin-ups, scientific historical images, anatomy and nostalgic panoramas as symbolic references. Combined in the work, they allow for commentary, connection and invention on many topics and ideas.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">ELISABETH TIMPONE BIO</span></p>


	<p>After studying communication design at Parson&#8217;s in <span class="caps">NYC</span>, Elisabeth Timpone unexpectedly began an extensive endeavor into a world of fine art. Her whimsically obsessive lines, and delicate but ferocious images capture moments in nature that may otherwise go unseen. Her drawings create a portal to the unscathed forest where animals live to play and fight to survive. Since her start, she has shown at galleries in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Elisabeth is currently working on a letter pressed children’s book called “Baby Bestiary”.</p>
