<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Vogt Gallery is pleased to present &#8220;BENEATH,&#8221; a group exhibition featuring works by American, European and South American artists in various media. &#8220;BENEATH&#8221; includes painting, sculpture, installation, photography and video by the artists Maiken Bent, Tatiana Blass, Travis Boyer, Jesse Aron Green, Philipp Messner, <span class="caps">MPA</span>, Paul Mpagi Sepuya and Zach Storm.</p>


	<p>&#8220;BENEATH&#8221; centers around the topics of body, skin and surface and explores the multi-faceted relationship between art and the human body. Figurative elements appear next to abstract forms, a geometric concrete cube serves as a vessel for a plant while suspended metal chains relate to a leather object reminiscent of human sexual fetish. Materials at play are copper, latex, iron powder, silk, wax, velvet, silver, leather, concrete and chrome. The intention of combining those heterogeneous works grows out of a curiosity towards contemporary perspectives on the three-part nexus of content, objectness and surface as a potential conduit between them.</p>


	<p>Danish artist Maiken Bent frequently treats issues of sexuality and object fetishization in general in her work. Her first museum solo show opened this year in Kristiansand, Norway.</p>


	<p>Brazilian artist Tatiana Blass often recreates human or animal bodies in wax, exploring the ephemeral shape qualities of the heat-sensitive material. She currently holds a residency at Gasworks, London and was presented at the 2010 Sao Paulo Biennial.</p>


	<p>Munich based Italian artist Philipp Messner applies a minimal aesthetic to his conceptual body of work. His use of media ranges from film to metal, fabric, wood and printmaking. Recent solo shows include Galeria Foksal, Warsaw, Poland and Kunstverein Goettingen, Germany.</p>


	<p>New York based Travis Boyer’s practice centers around painting and fiber arts as well as the performative possibilities of textiles. Boyer was awarded the 2011 Fire Island residency and is a 2012 Bard College graduate.</p>


	<p>Boston based Jesse Aron Green works mostly in video with a focus on performative aspects. He has shown internationally – at Tate Modern, London, among others, and was included in the 2010 Whitney Biennial.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">MPA</span> is based in New York. Her practice focuses on performance art and includes the use of objects as well as the creation of individual visual works. She has been shown at the Whitney Museum, New York. Her solo show “Directing Light onto Fist of Father” at Leo Koenig Inc. in 2011 was acclaimed in the New York Times. She was featured in the 2011 program of Performa, New York.</p>


	<p>New York based Paul Mpagi Sepuya’s main medium is photography. Encounters with friends lead to intimate portraits with an object-like quality. He was recently presented at the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, where he was artist-in-residence in 2010-2011.</p>


	<p>Zach Storm recently received his <span class="caps">MFA</span> from <span class="caps">MICA</span>, Maryland. His practice encompasses drawing and painting in both figurative as well as abstract forms. Storm is especially interested in exploring surface detail, objects of desire and spatial illusion. His work has been exhibited in galleries in the US including New York as well as in Europe and Japan.</p>


	<p>Vogt Gallery is committed to bringing attention to the complex artistic and cultural ties that bind New York to both Europe and Latin America. This is Vogt Gallery’s tenth exhibition, which continues the gallery&#8217;s mission of emphasizing curatorial practice to further artistic discussion.
Summer hours: Monday &#8211; Friday, 11 am-6 pm and by appointment.
