<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Monya Rowe Gallery is very pleased to present a group exhibition curated by José Lerma titled Famous Adults As Children, Famous Children As Adults featuring Joey Fauerso, Evan Gruzis, Christopher McNulty, John McKinnon, Brendan Mulcahy, Jesus Bubu Negron, Joe Pflieger, Andrew Rogers, Mark Schubert and Chemi Rosado Seijo. The exhibition examines themes of repetition, replication and the reformulation of existing works and ideas.</p>


	<p>Joey Fauerso is a painter and video artist from San Antonio, Texas. Her mesmerizing and elegant animations belie an extraordinary amount of labor. The process in her work If I&#8217;m thinking I&#8217;m probably feeling starts by filming a 10 second video of her brother. The individual frames of the video are turned into 227 oil and acrylic paintings, which are then re-shot and replayed in sequence</p>


	<p>Evan Gruzis is a painter and sculptor from Brooklyn, New York. Gruzis&#8217; work addresses the tension between sincerity and theatricality in a way that allows the viewer to enter a stylized yet vapid world. Charlotte is an ink drawing of a mannequin in a &#8220;new wave noir&#8221; aesthetic; it is at once a representation of a representation, a portrait and a still life.</p>


	<p>Christopher McNulty makes sculptures and drawings. He lives and works in Alabama, where he teaches at Auburn University. His work involves the obsessive repetition of a simple motif or action, which is drawn from fundamental processes of science and mathematics.</p>


	<p>John McKinnon, an artist and curator from Chicago, Illinois, records natural phenomena in his more recent process paintings. His monochromatic paintings are coated with water-soluble tempera and exposed to rain during McKinnon&#8217;s walks. The results are a mixture of abstract washes, painterly effects and the occasional fingerprint.</p>


	<p>Brendan Mulcahy is a photographer from New York City. Mulcahy&#8217;s photographs are always exhibited in pairs. The second photograph being an attempt to duplicate the information of the first with different subjects and often, different settings. Despite his preference for mundane subject matter and a matter of fact documentary style they are exquisite exercises in perception.</p>


	<p>Jesus &#8220;Bubu&#8221; Negron is a multidisciplinary artist from, Barceloneta, Puerto Rico. His works often operate as disguised poetic homages. Igualdad is the documentation of an intervention organized by Negron in 2004. For this work he entered the smokestack of an abandoned sugar plantation and proceeded to fill it up with debris, which he later set ablaze. Despite it being inactive for more than a generation, the people from the nearby town of Rincón were able to witness the theater of an operational plantation for a few hours.</p>


	<p>Joe Pflieger is a photographer and painter based in Princeton, New Jersey. Pflieger addresses in his work the inherent limitations of photography. His photos of vegetation and water, which are shot in daylight, slowly reveal themselves to the viewer.</p>


	<p>Andrew Rogers is an artist living in New York whose works develops out of an interest in southern iconography. For this exhibition, Rogers will exhibit a photograph of charcoal collected over several months from a bakery near his house in Brooklyn.</p>


	<p>Mark Schubert is a sculptor based in Brooklyn. Schubert makes formally complex sculptures that involve disposable materials; plastic chairs, coolers and other remnants of consumer society. The final forms are suggested by the aggressive manipulation of such objects. He is represented by Monya Rowe Gallery.</p>


	<p>Chemi Rosado Seijo is a multidisciplinary artist from San Juan, Puerto Rico. In El Bowl de La Perla, as in some of his other labor-intensive interventions, Rosado Seijo reconstitutes debris from demolished homes in the impoverished area of La Perla in San Juan into a working swimming pool, which doubles as a skateboarding bowl.</p>


	<p>José Lerma is an artist living and working in New York. He is represented by Andrea Rosen Gallery.</p>
