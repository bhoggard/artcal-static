<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Cords of the Easy Rescue is a show in which beauty is seen through playful imperfection. The space David Aron has created with his installation of painted cardboard, wood, and fabric feels light, thoughtful, appreciative, and happy. Unlike his older work which he is best known for, there is no raw emotion or catharsis. Here there is simplicity, thought, and observation.</p>


	<p>Two of his cardboard pieces in this show came from experimentation with painting, then peeling away layers of the cardboard. His designs are geometrical but retain a nice softness to them because of the imperfections from the peeling as well as from the nature of the material. His two other cardboard works are dioramas: one more specific and detailed than the other. The first is an alternate idea maquette for how the gallery was to be installed. The second is part of a small grouping of made and found objects that sit on the floor. David has fond memories of himself as a child with his mother cutting and painting cardboard to make boats. All of these pieces are filled with the same warmth and inquisitive feeling that recollection conjures up.</p>


	<p>The longest wall is a display of a collection of small black and white painted &#8220;woodlings&#8221;. Most were made from pieces recycled from previous projects. These &#8220;woodlings&#8221; are mysterious in their function but have clues as to possibly being toys of some kind. Each has its own character like different spirits. David has spoken about his father and how when he was younger, he would ask his father to buy him toys and that his father would answer, &#8220;When I was younger I nailed two sticks together and made an airplane!&#8221; Perhaps these could be said to be those kinds of toys for imaginative individuals.</p>


	<p>There are obvious references to Buddhism in this show. The miniature garlands of fabric that cross the tops of the walls is one. Although David&#8217;s meditation practice is essential to his life and is a great muse, this show aims to stay simple and personal enough to be seen as universal.</p>


	<p>David Aron and Little Cakes would like to thank film director, artist, graphic designer Mike Mills for being the impromptu curator for this show. Without his prodding, encouragement, and insight this show would have turned out very differently. For those familiar with both David&#8217;s and Mike&#8217;s work, perhaps you will be able to see the collaboration that must have taken place.</p>


	<p>Cords of the Easy Rescue is David Aron&#8217;s first solo show in New York City since 1998 when he regularly showed at Alleged Gallery. He has recently shown at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco and at Feigen Contemporary in New York.</p>
