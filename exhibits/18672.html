  <p><strong>Launch <span class="caps">F18</span></strong> is delighted to present <em>Kiosk</em>.  A group exhibition produced by Chicago based artist and curator Dan Devening.  The exhibition features work from Dan Devening, Ron Ewert, Sterling Lawrence, Christy Matson and Michael Pfisterer.  The exhibition will open Saturday, November 3 and continue through Saturday, December 1, 2012.</p>


	<p><strong>Kiosk</strong> is a social and interactive meeting point between ideation, declaration and audience. Like advertising kiosks and proclamatory banners used to promote events or consumer products—or seen historically in political contexts—Kiosk is a presentational array designed for both display and proposition. Riffing off exhibition and presentation theory, Dan Devening designed the focal point of the exhibition to scrutinize the disclosure and exposition of the works in the exhibition. The 7’ tall support structure features a central, vertical axis from which perpendicular arms project from each side. From those horizontal supports, works by 5 artists are attached and offered up for display and consideration. In most cases, the manifestation of an idea through a work of art is the primary intention of the artist; in this context it can only happen nearby, on top of and in close proximity to every other work in its proximity. As a result, the visual noise emanating from those other statements is continually in play with each work. There is specific and effective information communicated in the hanging pieces, but it’s experienced and contextualized within the concerns of several other, often conflicting positions. The shifting perspective that comes from walking around and through the Kiosk feels familiar—the media experience each of us encounter daily as we make our way through the world is a clear and direct referent. We see it on the streets: signage, billboards, traffic signals, walls plastered with graffiti and old handbills, all vie for our attention. With its own complex ability to distract and confuse, it also exists in a highly successful form in digital and television media. How we filter, focus and ultimately connect with just about any information—be it visual or otherwise—is a central concern of the exhibition and its particular system of presentation.</p>


	<p>As a point of comparison, the exhibition includes a selection of works by each artist installed more traditionally on each wall. Using this opportunity to add complexity and clarity to the Kiosk selections, the work here stands on its own, detached from the structure and free of the constraints of its neighbors. The explicability of the wall works helps us recognize the privilege of autonomy, singularity and individuation.</p>
