<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Sidi El Karchi was born between 5 and 7 am on March 6, 1975, Sittard, NL &#8211; the same day and time frame as Michelangelo. While still a student, he discovered this amazing coincidence, which increased his fascination for the Renaissance and Old Master painters whose influence is still visible in his work today.</p>


	<p>It is LMAKprojects&#8217; great pleasure to premier Sidi El Karchi&#8217;s exhibition, small world melancholy in New York. On one hand the exhibition&#8217;s title suggests a nostalgic allusion to dreams, thoughts and ideas of a youthful past. The artist visualizes these elements in a gorgeous painting that carries the title of the show, which depicts a young teen wearing a hoodie and is starring down. There is no eye contact with the viewer and it seems as if the boy wonders in his own world.</p>


	<p>On the other hand, small world melancholy refers to the artist&#8217;s first steps into the New York art world. He beautifully translates his hopes and fears in a self-portrait: the Hermit. He portrays himself against a black background, wearing a blue hoodie looking into the dark with a somewhat anxious, somewhat eager gaze.</p>


	<p>Sidi El Karchi&#8217;s works are mainly portraits of his girlfriend, family and friends. Sometimes he creates landscapes, like Mary and Child, which is based on a statue in Maastricht. As the viewer, you watch over Mary&#8217;s shoulder starring into a deep, dark valley. His careful and meticulous attention to light, color and depth results in perfectly composed, light and transparent paintings with a serene and almost religious aura. The starting point for all his works are photographs which he either takes or finds from his subjects. Recently, a photograph of Oprah Winfrey taken during a ceremony for Martin Luther King, left a great impression on the artist which he interpreted into an amazing and powerful portrait of the star. He depicts her almost as a Saint, with her hands folded which is underscored by the title: Icon.</p>


	<p>Sidi El Karchi finds his inspiration in our daily lives. He creates surprising and intriguing imagery by omitting unnecessary details. Resulting in mainly flat works without any perspective. He aspires to create a lucid image to establish a relation between the painting and the viewer.</p>
