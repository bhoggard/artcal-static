  <p>Artists: Scott Calhoun, Ricardo Gonzalez, Joseph Hart, Timothy Marvel Hull, Juliet Jacobson, Butt Johnson, Kristine Robinson, Kimi Weart, and Sam Wilson</p>


	<p>33 Bond is pleased to announce Pulp Dream, a group exhibition that examines the elusiveness and fleeting narratives of dreams through works on paper. The exhibition includes drawings, collages, paper sculptures, and etchings by nine emerging artists.</p>


	<p>The works diverge in theme, media, and size, but all connote the mystery, acuteness, confusion, illusion, or fantasy of dreams. Each piece in the exhibition seizes a different aspect of the dream experience: some tell surreal and evasive stories, some mix memories with the present, and some conjure blurry, nightmarish fears or sexual desires. For instance, Juliet Jacobson&#8217;s rich, graphite drawings relate the duality of love, desire, and eroticism. Kimi Weart&#8217;s large-scale drawings capture the tension past incidents or lurking threats can imprint on places. Much like the lasting, vivid, or haunting feelings dreams can induce, Weart&#8217;s drawings reveal the marking impressions events can leave behind. Sam Wilson&#8217;s ultra-realistic spider plant sculptures play with the concepts of reality versus illusion. Kristine Robinson and Scott Calhoun&#8217;s compositions layer images, flashing segments of fictions and personal memories.</p>


	<p>Scott Calhoun (b. 1971) received his <span class="caps">MFA</span> at the University of Houston in 1998.
