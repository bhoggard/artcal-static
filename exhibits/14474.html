  <p>Trickster Theater Performances are free and open to the public. “Theater is free, because art should be free” -Papo Colo, Artistic Director</p>


	<p>Trickster Theater programs are free to the public thanks to the generous support from the Lambent Foundation Fund of the Tides Foundation.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">NEW YORK</span> –Exit Art in-residence Trickster Theater is pleased to premiere a new original work and a special late night performance event directed and conceived by Artistic Director, Papo Colo this August.</p>


	<p>Trickster Theater is creating new works that reflect the diverse audiences and influences of New York City.  Trickster’s mission is to produce experimental performance theater works that challenge the formal canon and expand the audience’s notion of contemporary theatre.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">VORTEX</span> is a view of the Americas via the lens of two iconic poets, Pablo Neruda and Walt Whitman. Crisscrossing historical and geographical landscapes, wrapped in Pablo Casals’ Bach suites, Whitman and Neruda find the most supreme versions of themselves as they interconnect between English and Spanish, and North and South America in a dance-theatre conversation about where we’ve been as a continent. The <span class="caps">VORTEX</span> attempts to re-imagine what modern Americana means: a stage that represents the complexity and diversity of contemporary America with a new use of poetry in a context of dramatic texts and extraordinary set design.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CONFESSIONS</span> is an intimate, late-night theatrical experience presenting Trickster actors, playing themselves, confessing to an audience.  These confessions are given dramatic context by the ceremonial process enacted in this unique performance event.  Actors are guided to embrace the musicality of language and the performative religiosity of confessing.  These late night Confessions will produce volition on the part of the actor, creating a space for the performers to intimately share with their audience.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">THE VORTEX PERFORMERS</span>: Mauricio Leyton*, Ernesto Nodal, Elinor Thompson</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CONFESSIONS PERFORMERS</span>: Shannon Altner, Megan Branch, Cara Loften, 
Siobhan O’Loughlin, Alexa Thorson, and Hannah Scott</p>


	<p><span class="caps">THE VORTEX</span> and <span class="caps">CONFESSIONS</span> conceived and directed by Papo Colo.</p>

We do experimental, historical and unique presentations of aesthetic, social, political and environmental issues. We absorb cultural differences that become prototype exhibitions. We are a center for multiple disciplines. Exit Art is a 29-year-old cultural center in New York City founded by Directors Jeanette Ingberman and artist Papo Colo, that has grown from a pioneering alternative art space, into a model artistic center for the 21st century committed to supporting artists whose quality of work reflects the transformations of our culture. Exit Art is internationally recognized for its unmatched spirit of inventiveness and consistent ability to anticipate the newest trends in the culture. With a substantial reputation for curatorial innovation and depth of programming in diverse media, Exit Art is always changing.</p>

	<p><span class="caps">ABOUT TRICKSTER THEATER</span>
Papo Colo founded Trickster Theater in 1998. Since its inception, an important aspect of the Trickster Theater is its role as a multilingual and multinational theater, creating theater as global and local as its audience. Trickster Theater investigates the American language and the relationship of different accents and tonalities. The theater has a history of bilingual productions that tackle issues of translation in the dramatic arts. Trickster has produced a range of shows including Praying Project, Wild Nights, Tropical Area, Cannon Dialogues, Confessions of the Face, Somehow, Still Life, and Distant Sex, which can be viewed on Exit Media and Trickster Theater&#8217;s website.</p>

Quinn; and public funds from the New York State Council on the Arts.</p>
