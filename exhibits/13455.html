<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Causey Contemporary is pleased to  announce the opening of their May exhibition, Way Stations II by Maryland Sculptor, Alan Binstock.  This exhibition marks a return of Mr. Binstock’s work to the gallery after several  years hiatus during which he not only created a new large scale body of outdoor work but also exhibited at the Katsen Center at American University in Washington. D. C.   The American Center for Physics in College Park MD, Zenith Gallery in Washington,D.C.  and in a solo retrospective at the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.  Director, Tracy Causey-Jeffery is delighted to host Way Stations II &#8211; A second showing of Mr. Binstock’s outdoor sculptures as well as his more intimate table top pieces.  The exhibition also marks Alan’s second solo exhibition with the gallery.  Way Stations II opens with an artist’s reception on May 20 from 6-9 pm  at the gallery’s location of 92 Wythe Avenue in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.  It continues through June 12 during gallery hours: Wed. &#8211; Sat.  11 am &#8211; 7 p.m., Sun. 12 &#8211; 6 p.m. And Mon. 9 am &#8211; 5 p.m..</p>


	<p>Alan Binstock’s Exhibition title  Way Stations II refers to Clifford D. Simak’s classic 1960’s science fiction novel about virtue and galatic travel.  Alan who is both a sculptor and an architect works today to support <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s mission at the Goddard Space Flight center.  He says that he has “always been intrigued by the macro and micro worlds suggested by space “landscapes” that surround [him] at <span class="caps">NASA</span> and their similarities to magnified views of our own cell structure.   The scientific explorations around [him] nourishes the pilgrim’s search.”</p>


	<p>Way-stations themselves are stopping points: at times mental, physical or metaphysical places along a path.  Sometimes they are a momentary pause, other times a lengthy reflection and still other times they pass unnoticed.   Alan investigates in his sculptures, forms which to him express the nature of a pilgrim’s inner passage while capturing the wonder of the explorer’s outward search to find meaning in the universe.  Thus what better title to choose for this newest series of large and small scale sculptures than “Way Stations”.</p>


	<p>The outdoor works have allowed Mr. Binstock new opportunities to develop his simple glass and steel forms.  Shatterd glass, resin, dyes and steel provide the elements of each sculpture’s structure.  His goal is to draw people into, onto and through the sculptures so that they become participants in and part of the creation.</p>


	<p>Alan Binstock was born and raised in the Bronx, New York.  His formal art education began in the New York High School of Music and Art followed by undergraduate studies at Hunter College.  After teaching Fine Arts in a South Bronx Junior High School and a year of travel, Alan settled in Colorado.   While there he worked in wood, stone, silver and deer antlers creating sculptures influenced by the amorphous forms of Jans Arp and Henry Moore.   He also worked for Quest foundry there and learned bronze casting and finishing.  Additionally, he began his study of Yoga and later became a teacher at the Integral Yoga Institute in Boulder, Co.  He continued these pursuits at the Satchidananda Ashram in Connecticut.  Alan than embarked upon a graduate program in Architecture at the University of Maryland which gave him a new perspective on three dimensional design.   Since that time he has worked as a registered architect in the Maryland, Washington D.C. area and at <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Goddard Space Flight Center, practiced yoga and sculpted.   His continued education in construction materials and methods coupled with his Yoga practices inform his sculpture.</p>


	<p>Nancy Ungar of Sculpture Magazine said of Alan that he “uses his art to give shape to the spiritual and intellectual searching that has informed his life.  His elegant minimal forms are honed to a poetic accuracy that illuminates complex statements through form, contrasting materials, and especially color.   The purity of these forms is such that Binstock’s mellifluous combinations of steel and glass seem to have been born without his intervention.”</p>


	<p>Alan Binstock has exhibited his sculptures in glass, steel, stone and now glass, steel and resin since the early nineties throughout the Maryland/D.C. Area, Delaware, New York, New Jersey and Florida.  With Causey Contemporary, his smaller scale sculptures have gone to fairs in  L.A. and Miami.   His creations are in private and public collections around the United States and have been reviewed by Sculpture Magazine, The Washington Post, The D.C. Examiner and the Gazette.</p>


	<p>Way Stations II at Causey Contemporary marks Alan’s second solo exhibition in New York City since 2000.  The exhibition runs at Causey Contemporary’s Williamsburg Brooklyn location &#8211; 92 Wythe Avenue from May 20 &#8211; June 12, 2011.  The public is invited to attend an artist’s reception with Alan on May 20 from 6 &#8211; 9pm and then to visit the exhibition during normal gallery hours : Wednesday &#8211; Saturday  11 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m. Sundays  12 &#8211; 6 p.m. and Mondays  9 a.m. &#8211; 5 p.m.   For more information on Alan Binstock or Way Stations II contact Causey Contemporary at 718 218 8939 or visit the website <a href="http://www.causeycontemporary.com">www.causeycontemporary.com</a></p>
