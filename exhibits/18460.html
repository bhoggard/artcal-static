“Bastards of Misrepresentation” is a show about the cultural scene happening in the Philippines yet is not a definitive show about Philippine art. The 20 artists included represent the “now” of contemporary art in Manila whose works entice and challenge perceptions. Many of the artists have been recognized by the country’s most prestigious awards from the Cultural Center of the Philippines’ Artist Awards and the Ateneo Art Awards, and are establishing reputations in Europe, Australia, and Asia, while locally others are highly visible as performers in the underground art, performance and music scene. With an Asian Cultural Council award for the exhibition, <span class="caps">TOPAZ ARTS</span> has invited three of the artists from Manila — Yason Banal, Lena Cobangbang and Maria Jeona Zoleta — to participate as Artists-in-Residence, creating new works, site-specific installations and performances. The diverse artists are intergenerational and international including Poklong Anading, Bea Camacho, Valeria Cavestany, Maria Cruz, Gaston Damag, Dex Fernandez, Arvin Flores, Dina Gadia, David Griggs, Robert Langenegger, Romeo Lee, Pow Martinez, Jayson Oliveria, Carlo Ricafort, Timo Roter, Gerry Tan, and MM Yu. A catalogue will accompany the exhibition with essays by Gina Fairley, Patrick D. Flores, Manuel Ocampo, and Paz Tanjuaquio &#38; Todd Richmond of <span class="caps">TOPAZ ARTS</span>.</p>


	<p>“Bastards of Misrepresentation” is seen for the first time in <span class="caps">NYC</span>, previously shown with 14 artists in 2010 in Berlin at the Freies Museum and Hamburg at 8 Salon, and at H Gallery in Bangkok in May 2012. Simulating Manila’s energetic arts scene – from alternative spaces and Chelsea-like galleries to university museums and high-end galleries in the city’s ubiquitous malls – the artist-run project is dispersed throughout <span class="caps">NYC</span>, headquartered at the painting-focused show at <span class="caps">TOPAZ ARTS</span>, to performance work and video at the Asian/Pacific/American Institute at <span class="caps">NYU</span>, to various media works “Doing Time on Filipino Time” at Crossing Art Gallery situated in Flushing’s Queens Crossing Mall, and transforming the Queens Museum of Art/Partnership Gallery with an installation of a fictive call center office. As the Philippines is a country with a hybrid culture, the show deals with issues about aesthetic autonomy, social critique and the philosophical politics of expression. While the exhibition is focused on Manila artists, Bastards of Misrepresentation represents a complex cultural scene, addressing global issues, shared histories and the urban experience.</p>


	<p>Bastards of Misrepresentation: New York Edition has been organized by <span class="caps">TOPAZ ARTS</span>, Inc. and by artist/curator Manuel Ocampo with the support of the Asian Cultural Council.</p>
