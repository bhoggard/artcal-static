	<p><span class="caps">ABOUT GRACE EXHIBITION SPACE</span> for <span class="caps">PERFORMANCE ART</span></p>


	<p>Grace Exhibition Space, since 2006, is devoted exclusively to Performance Art. We offer an opportunity to experience visceral and challenging performance works by the current generation of international performance artists, whether emerging, mid career or established.</p>


	<p>Being a Brooklyn loft, our events are presented on the floor, not on a stage, dissolving the boundary between artist and viewer. This is how performance art is meant to be experienced and our mission is the glorification of performance art.</p>


	<p>&#8220;Grace Exhibition Space is the sole gallery in this city that shows specifically, in its most intentionally narrow definition, Performance Art.&#8221; Patricia Milder, The Brooklyn Rail (May, 2011)</p>


	<p>&#8220;Through such intimate encounters between performance groups and their guests, they could follow in the spirit of Yoko Ono&#8217;s Chamber Street loft or the Surrealist soirees of Paris.&#8221; Warren Fry, The Brooklyn Rail (August, 2007)</p>
