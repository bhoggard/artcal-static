  <p>With <span class="caps">SNOWBLIND</span>, Klughaus Gallery, in conjunction with Carnage and Making Deals Zine, is proud to present a group of artists who have captured the gritty pleasures of the winter season.</p>


	<p>Photographs from renowned urban documentarian Martha Cooper and Carnage zine creator Ray Mock show slush, sludge, and frozen faces contrasted with empty, peaceful city streets and the blinding white of last night’s snowfall. The show also features clever, snow-inspired artwork and photography from Jesse Edwards, Mike P, Ian Reid, Alexander Richter, Steven Siegel, Michael Fales, Oscar Arriola, Graham Shimberg and Bob Barry.</p>


	<p>The show’s opening reception will mark the launch of issue #2 of Carnage, a limited edition zine featuring the prolific and highly distinctive work of New York City’s <span class="caps">ATM</span> Crew. There will also be 5 very limited boxsets for sale that will include stickers and special Carnage and <span class="caps">ATM</span> Crew-related ephemera.</p>


	<p>Klughaus Gallery exhibits a variety of contemporary art. The gallery works primarily with artists that have roots in graffiti and street culture and seeks to develop itself as a leader in fostering urban art appreciation within the local (Chinatown/LES) community.</p>


	<p>Klughaus Gallery is located at 47 Monroe Street, New York, <span class="caps">NY 10002</span>. Gallery hours are Thursdays and Fridays from 1-7pm, Saturdays and Sundays from 12-6pm. For more information, please email <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1871767e775873746d7f70796d6b36767d6c">[email&#160;protected]</a> or call (646) 801-6024.</p>

	<p>Artist Information</p>


	<p>Martha Cooper is a documentary photographer who has specialized in shooting urban vernacular art and architecture for over thirty years. Her work has been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide and published extensively in magazines from National Geographic to Vibe. Some of her publications include Subway Art, New York State of Mind, Going Postal, and most recently, Tokyo Tattoo 1970.</p>


	<p>Ray Mock’s mission as a photographer is to capture the uncooptable core of city culture and make ugly look pretty. His work has been featured in books, in magazines and on countless websites. He publishes Carnage and likes to hang around trains.</p>


	<p>Jesse Edwards is a Seattle based artist who focuses on oil paintings ranging from classic landscapes to more unconventional still-lifes. In addition to his paintings of guns, marijuana plants and graffiti tools, he is known for his pixilated nudes as well as his quality work with ceramics. He has studied at the Cornish School of the Arts and Gage Academy and has exhibited his work throughout the United States in many prominent galleries and museums including Seattle’s Center on Contemporary Art (CoCA), Woodside/Braseth Gallery, <span class="caps">BLVD</span> Gallery, Deitch Projects, The Hole <span class="caps">NYC</span>, and The Museum of Sex. Edwards has also been featured in many prestigious publications including the New York Times, Seattle Times, Vice Magazine, Seattle PI, and City Arts Magazine.</p>


	<p>Steven Siegel has been photographing the streets and subways of New York for the past 30 years. When young people today look at his shots from the 1980ʼs, they are aghast. To them, New York of the 1980ʼs is almost unrecognizable. Steven has exhibited his work at many prestigious institutions including the New York State Museum, Federal Hall, Hudson Waterfront Museum, and more. He graduated Columbia University with a Masters of Science in Urban Planning.</p>


	<p>Mike P is a New York City based artist who works in a wide range of mediums focusing on painting and illustration. His art can be found in one form or another in many of the places that he has traveled around the world.</p>


	<p>Alexander Richter is an <span class="caps">NYC</span> based commercial photographer specializing in portraits for editorial, advertising and the music industries. When he is not making pictures, he can be found with his wife in Maine drinking fresh squeezed lemonade and eating lobster rolls.</p>


	<p>Michael Fales can be found photographing the streets as the city comes alive in the morning, or exploring it’s tucked-away nooks. His photos have appeared on numerous websites, books, and exhibitions. He currently resides in Brooklyn with his wife and two cats.</p>


	<p>Graham Shimberg is a photographer, track-walker, freight-nerd, and bindle-stiff.</p>


	<p>Bob Barry documents graffiti amidst the paranoia and the Disney-fication of a post-9/11 New York.</p>


	<p>Oscar Arriola is a Chicago-based photographer who has enjoyed documenting graffiti, city life, tuxedo cats, rogue cops, and artists since the mid-80&#8217;s. His photography has been featured in the recent Chicago Street Art book.</p>
