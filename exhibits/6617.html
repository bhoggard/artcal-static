  <p>1.
You call me up and tell me you&#8217;ve got this big X lying around the living room. It&#8217;s really got you down in the dumps, you say. Last night you got very upset, lost control, and put a line through it. Well, now it looks like *, but bigger. I wouldn&#8217;t call that a solution, I say, but it&#8217;s definitely a forward movement. I mean this as a joke. But I cannot tell if you smile at my joke, which does not call for a laugh, because you are on the phone. When we next meet, we&#8217;ve both forgotten all about this exchange.</p>


	<p>2.
What we&#8217;re doing here is pointing at. We&#8217;re pointing at the interstice between the pointer and the object at which it points, the shape of its pointing.  What we&#8217;re not doing here is looking at pictures of our mothers, even though there are pictures of our mothers here. We&#8217;re not really having a sculptural or spatial experience, even though there are objects around and this is a space. Politics is a non-privileged part of this cultural arrangement. Just because it has video does not mean it is video; just because it has photography doesn&#8217;t mean that it is photography, unless it is.  And we&#8217;re definitely not doing colors, even though there are colors and polygons and Albers.</p>


	<p>3.
Look.  It will be laconic. More laconic than this. Extremely so.</p>


	<p>4.
One time I owned four horses. I used one for carrying apples, one for oranges, one for bananas, and one for motorcycles. For these reasons, I called the horses, respectively, &#8220;Apples,&#8221; &#8220;Oranges,&#8221; &#8220;Bananas,&#8221; and &#8220;Motorcycles,&#8221; who was the most beautiful of them. As we were walking out to the corral one morning, I asked my son, &#8220;Do you like riding motorcycles?&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Not really, I don&#8217;t like riding horses.&#8221;</p>


	<p>5.
If, in the middle of everything, there were visible nothing, if the subjunctive mood were a sensual experience, if Now were an algorithmic function of Whens, and This a strict causal relative of That, if medium were nothing but between, if we could enact a dynamic cessation between the number and the footnote, then we would be there at the point vertex of here and now.</p>

You call me up and tell me you&#8217;ve got this big O lying around the living room. It&#8217;s really got you down in the dumps, you say. Last night you got very upset, lost control, and put a line through it. Well, now it looks like Ã¸, but bigger. I wouldn&#8217;t call that a solution, I say, but it&#8217;s definitely a forward movement. I mean this as a joke. But I cannot tell if you smile at my joke, which does not call for a laugh, because you are on the phone. When we next meet, we&#8217;ve both forgotten all about this exchange.</p>
