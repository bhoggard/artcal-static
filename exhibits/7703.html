  <p>Curated by Michael Bühler-Rose</p>


	<p>Talia Chetrit, Adrian Crabbs, Joy Drury Cox, Van Hanos, David Haxton, Matt Johnson, Ryan Kitson, Roula Partheniou and Austin Willis</p>


	<p>Priska C. Juschka Fine Art is pleased to present The Form Itself, curated by Michael Bühler-Rose. The artists in this exhibition engage a variety of mediums in a self-reflective dialogue on the potential and purity of their respective discipline&#8217;s forms.</p>


	<p>David Haxton and Talia Chetrit both tinker in photographic alchemy. Chetrit reduces photography to its purest element, light, in the form of primary colors and black and white test strips. Haxton records the remnants of performances that investigate the way light creates photographic space.</p>


	<p>Adrian Crabbs utilizes a shipping pallet as a printing plate, placing a standard item directly into the art making process. Stripping job applications to their compositional essentials, Joy Drury Cox&#8217;s drawings point to the standard institutional space that is between the lines of all potential employment. Through the video recording of chromatic scales, Austin Willis lays bare the basics of video, image and sound, and creates a unique composition that uses his library of footage.</p>


	<p>Van Hanos, Matt Johnson, Ryan Kitson and Roula Partheniou create perceptually challenging works that investigate the potential of a variety of visual conventions. Hanos uses faux marbleizing and Venetian plaster techniques that connects abstract painting to a new form of Modernism. Johnson&#8217;s work at first reads as an abstract image, but is actually a &#8220;Magic Eye&#8221; camouflaging a wholly figurative solution. Kitson uses an everyday object to create both a conceptually and emotionally engaging sculpture. Partheniou&#8217;s projects challenge the possibilities of standard forms with ready-made canvases representing items of the same dimensions, and Rubik&#8217;s cubes forming conceptual sculpture.</p>


	<p>Michael Bühler-Rose received a <span class="caps">BFA</span> from The School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. He also received an <span class="caps">MFA</span> from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida as well as a Fulbright Fellowship to India. His work has shown at Bose Pacia, New York, The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Die Photographische Sammlung/SK Stiftung Kultur, Cologne, and The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, New Delhi. His projects have been reviewed in The New York Times, Time Out New York and AM New York.</p>
