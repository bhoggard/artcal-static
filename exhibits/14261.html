  <p><strong>Alternate Routes:
New Work by Keyholder Residents</strong>
Opening Reception: Wednesday, July 13, 6-8 pm</p>


	<p>Exhibition Dates: July 11 – September 7, 2011
Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 &#8211; 6pm

	<p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to announce Alternate Routes: New Work by Keyholder Artists in Residence, with a reception for artists on Wednesday, July 13, 6 – 8pm. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from July 11 – September 7, 2011 and features new works created by eight of this year’s recipients of the Printshop’s prestigious Keyholder Residencies.</p>


	<p>The Keyholder Residency provides emerging artists with free, year-long access to professional printmaking facilities to develop new work and foster their artistic careers. Artists of all disciplines participate as Keyholders and gain access to the Printshop&#8217;s vibrant community. Felipe Baeza, <span class="caps">LNY</span>, Priscila De Carvalho, Maria Ignacia Edwards, Laurie Frick, Arturo Meade, Laimah Osman and Frank Webster have all broadened their artistic practice through creative exploration, career development opportunities, and immersion in the world of printmaking. From collage, to cutting, to embroidery—their new works demonstrate delight and curiosity in experimenting with new materials, and a desire to explore new possibilities in their artistic practice.</p>
