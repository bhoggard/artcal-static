  <p><strong>Alternate Routes:
New Work by Keyholder Residents</strong>
Opening Reception: Wednesday, July 13, 6-8 pm</p>


	<p>Exhibition Dates: July 11 – September 7, 2011
Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 &#8211; 6pm

	<p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to announce Alternate Routes: New Work by Keyholder Artists in Residence, with a reception for artists on Wednesday, July 13, 6 – 8pm. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from July 11 – September 7, 2011 and features new works created by eight of this year’s recipients of the Printshop’s prestigious Keyholder Residencies.</p>


	<p>The Keyholder Residency provides emerging artists with free, year-long access to professional printmaking facilities to develop new work and foster their artistic careers.
