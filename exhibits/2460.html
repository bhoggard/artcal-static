<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>The Bronx River Arts Center presents an exhibition of new work by 13 transplanted New Orleans and Gulf Coast Artists. This group exhibition, curated by Aristides Logothetis, brings focus to the fervent, diverse, and ongoing community responses to Katrina through new paintings, photographs, sculptures, video and installations.</p>


	<p>The devastation caused by the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina has caused many Gulf Coast artists to be without homes and studios. In response, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council has created a one-time, emergency residency providing studio space, living stipends and funding to 14 artists from the region. This significant response enables these artists to continue making art in a supportive environment and provides an opportunity to rebuild their Gulf Coast community in TriBeCa.</p>
