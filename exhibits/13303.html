Opening Exhibition: Atom, Planet by Anne Arden McDonald.</p>


	<p>On March 18th there will be a new addition to the most established gallery community in Brooklyn: Skink Ink Editions will open on North 10th Street in Williamsburg. At Skink Ink we will new be launching our new exhibition program with a edition of prints by the photographer Anne Arden McDonald (<a href="http://www.anneardenmcdonald.com">www.anneardenmcdonald.com</a>). An exceptional photographer who from age 15 to 30 made photographic self portraits; building installations in the landscape or abandoned interiors and making private performances for her camera in these spaces. She has more recently been making process-inspired images and site specific installations which involve photography and sculpture.</p>


	<p>Atom, Planet by Anne Arden McDonald. 
This project is about developing processes to make imagery on photographic paper without using a negative, to allow a dialogue with the materials while still working with light, paper and chemistry. Some of the processes include making contact prints of objects, painting with bleach on blackened photo paper, or building layered piles of glass and eggshells and running around them with a flashlight to make an exposure. Upwards of 80 medicines, spices and household cleaners were tested by painting them onto photo paper, before running the image through the developer and fix. Some of the images were made in the dark and some in daylight, some processes are additive and others are reductive. This exhibition, which is a series of images about circles and spheres meant to represent planets and atoms, attempts to visualize the macrocosm and the microcosm of life.</p>


	<p>In the past 16 years, Anne has had 42 solo exhibitions in 11 countries and has been published in over 100 periodicals in 20 countries. Her works are in the collections of 6 major museums and she is also teaches photography at Parsons School of Design in New York.</p>

	<p>Background information</p>


	<p>Skink Ink Fine Art Printing™ is a digital printing studio located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY. Founded by Philip Riley who is its’ lead artist and printer. In the early 1990’s he was the director of a public gallery in London called ‘The Centre 181 Gallery’, showing artists such as Liam Gillick, Simon Patterson, Gillian Wearing and Yinka Shonibare. Seven of those whose work he showed went on to be nominated for the UK’s premier ‘Turner Prize’. Two went on to win it, they were Gillian Wearing in 1997 and Jeremy Deller in 2004.</p>


	<p>Skink Ink’s gallery and printing studio will operate out of the same space. We will produce limited edition folios of Archival Pigment prints in collaboration with chosen artists and exhibit them in the space. The editions will be for sale as folios and as individual prints. In addition talks, classes, workshops and events will be held to bring together and to educate a community of artists and collectors about this emerging fine art medium.</p>
