  <p><strong>Crossing Art is pleased to announce and welcome the buoyant works by artists, dEmo and <span class="caps">DEPOE</span> in the exhibition, <span class="caps">POP</span>, POP.</strong>  Exuding elements of the movement of Pop Art, with a 21st Century twist, the exhibition features a whimsical maze of dEmo’s colorful Bear sculptures in three various sizes, with the largest measuring in at a colossal, seven-feet! <span class="caps">DEPOE</span>’s creation encapsulates the rainbow bright bears with his massive and equally colorful wall mural, wrapped around the entire gallery space. While dEmo discovers hidden meanings in everyday elements, transforming them into veritable icons that invite the viewer to adopt his playful attitude, <span class="caps">DEPOE</span> challenges the viewer’s perspective with abstract interpretations of graffiti art in a gallery setting. Pop, Pop is a visual narrative of dEmo’s desire to make one smile and <span class="caps">DEPOE</span>’s ability to stimulate the eye with his vibrant colors in a myriad of patterns that speaks the language of the street.</p>


	<p><strong>Eladio del Mora, aka dEmo</strong>, is one of Spain’s most original, internationally acclaimed artists and a multidisciplinary creator with an unmistakable aesthetic rooted in Pop Art. dEmo has expressed his intent, almost like a mantra, “…[is] to seduce the audience with humor, without losing view of the sculpture as a question and an engine for the mind.” Presented in a non-confrontational way, the Bears do this without a hint of tension, engaging the viewer to smile while drawing them deeper into the work.</p>


	<p>Achieving his first retrospective early on in his career at the Drissien Gallery of Munich, Germany, dEmo’s work has now become a constant presence traveling all around the world from museums to institutions to galleries and public spaces.  His Bears and other works can be viewed in the Skulpturenpark Artpark, Vienna, Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Cuba, the Coca-Cola Foundation, the Valencia Institute of Modern Art and all throughout Madrid, including the <span class="caps">IFEMA</span>, where his larger-than-life, 18 foot Bear sculpture is permanently installed. His work has also been exhibited in various cities of France, London, Portugal, Austria, Mexico and Italy, including the 2010 Venice Biennale, which featured an installation of his, Osos and Gatos (Bears and Cats).</p>


	<p><strong>Jonathan “DEPOE” Villoch</strong>’s work is an evolution of earlier graffiti pieces. The artist has retained the roots of his street art by continuing to incorporate intricate line work and art deco hues synonymous with the style.  By altering a cube motif, Jonathan is able to include his fascination with traditional symbols dating back to the times of hieroglyphics and other primitive forms that have undergone a metamorphosis to give his murals a three-dimensional feel.  Abandoning any concern for figurative representation, his ideas and emotions are communicated through visual rhythms and patterns.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">DEPOE</span> has exhibited and worked at world renown Deitch Projects, created site-specific mural projects for the Blanket Factory, Ad Hoc Art Gallery and several other locations all throughout New York City, Miami, and California. Recent noteworthy projects include Fresh Produce, in participation with Graffiti Gone Global curated by Cristina Gonzalez (Miami), Pop Americana, curated by Michael Ricardo Andrev (New York City) and the private commission, Surround Sound in Stereo in Brooklyn.</p>
