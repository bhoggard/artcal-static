	<p><strong><span class="caps">HERMINE FORD</span></strong> makes paintings using visual material from a wide variety of natural and man-made sources including direct observation, topography, cartography, textiles, and mosaics. Ford was born in New York City in 1939. She grew up on East 23rd Street. Her childhood neighborhood went from East 23rd down 2nd Avenue to Houston Street and all points East. Her first extended stays away from the sidewalks of New York, to the ‘green world’ came at summer camp in New Jersey, provided by her local Settlement House. In the years since, she has spent long periods of time in rela¬tively uninhabited spaces on the Atlantic seaboard, and also long visits to Rome. She lives and works in New York and Nova Scotia. A book featuring the collaboration between poet Kathleen Frasier and Ford was recently published by Granary Books.</p>


	<p>Ford graduated from Antioch College (’62) spending one year as an undergradu¬ate at Yale School of Art and Architecture. In 1977 she received a <span class="caps">CAPS</span> Grant from New York State Council on the Arts. and has been a Visiting Artist/Lecturer at Rhode Island School of Design, School of Art Institute of Chicago, New York Studio School, Bennington College, and The American Academy in Rome among others.

	<p><em><span class="caps">AND IN THE BACKROOM</span>: SUZANNE <span class="caps">GOLDENBERG</span>: Sculpture</em></p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">SUZANNE GOLDENBERG</span></strong> is a mixed media artist working in a variety of media including drawing, collage, textiles, video and sculpture. Through an improvisational process, she transforms found and scavenged materials, often what might be considered detritus and of no apparent value, into unexpected sculptural compositions that bear traces of the emotional, the architectural and the comic, but are ultimately non-literal. In these sculptures, the materials retain their histories as the waste by-product of our consumer society, but through a sensitivity to their other possible lives, Goldenberg transforms them into rich materials forming precarious structures poised between growth and collapse. She teaches art and gardening in <span class="caps">NYC</span> public schools and community gardens, while making and showing work abroad and at alternative spaces in NY.</p>


	<p>Ms. Goldenberg received a B.A. in Film from McGill University and an <span class="caps">MFA</span> from the Maryland Institute College of Art. She attended the Aljira Emerge Program, NJ and has received residencies from <span class="caps">LMCC</span>’s Swing Space program; Rotunda Gallery/BCAT Residency; and Chashama, <span class="caps">NYC</span>. She is a recipient of The Gottlieb Foundation Grant. Her work has been exhibited internationally, most recently at <span class="caps">CANADA</span> Gallery, <span class="caps">PS 122</span>, and Art in General all in New York City.</p>


	<p>Goldenberg lives and works in New York City.</p>
