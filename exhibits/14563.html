  <p>BoxoFFICE is proud to present <em>TO bee</em>, a solo exhibition by Megan Evans. Based in Melbourne, Australia, Evans&#8217; career spans a spectrum of art practices from major public commissions and interventions to exhibition work. Her artwork is conceptually based, utilising a range of media from painting and drawing to video and installation. Over the past two decades, Evans has addressed issues of cultural memory, ideas of selfhood and the balance within the delicate nature of bio-systems. Her current work explores landscape and colonisation in a contemporary context and investigates ideas of place.</p>


	<p>In <em>TO bee</em>, Evans will present a body of work that endeavors to question our ability to think collectively in the face of impending climate change:</p>


	<p>For twenty years I have been interested in what I call Indigenous Intelligence; the way many indigenous cultures across the world have structured their social organisation around the collective rather than the individual. This has led me to an interest in what it takes for humanity as a whole to act collectively, motivated by a wish for the good of all rather than a desire for self-fulfilment.</p>


	<p>Through a rather cursory investigation into swarm intelligence, I discovered bees which have been seen throughout history as an example of a kind of utopian existence that has eluded us as a species.The Bee Project is a long term project that looks at these issues through a variety of art practices including exhibition, performance, and social sculpture. The current series of exhibitions, titled <em>TO bee</em>, look specifically at bees, relating to them as individual creatures which is anathema to the bee who exists only in a colony.</p>


	<p><em>TO bee</em> incorporates photography, video, sculptural installation and large scale drawings inspired by research carried out in the New York State countryside as well as in metropolitan Melbourne and in New York City.</p>


	<p>Artist Profile
Evans completed her Masters of Fine Art at the Victorian College of the Arts and her Doctorate of Philosophy at Victoria University and has undertaken a significant number of collaborative public art commissions which have informed her imperative to engage directly with social and natural issues.</p>


	<p>Evans&#8217; work has been exhibited in many solo and group exhibitions in Australia and the UK. Her artist in the community work includes a wide range of projects from social interventions in Australia to animation in South Africa and mural work in New York City. She has published widely and regularly contributes to state and local government advisory panels in Australia.</p>


	<p>Evans has been recognized in reviews and articles and has received many awards and grants including the Sir Ian Potter Award and the Wyndham Contemporary Art Prize. Her work is represented in a range of private and corporate collections.</p>


	<p>BoxoFFICE is dedicated to furthering contemporary art from the new frontier. While frontier may conjure a geographic image, it is actually a spirit that lives in many places simultaneously. The artists that BoxoFFICE cooperates with are each singular in their practice. They address a range of subjects, in a variety of media, working freely, boldly and independently. Some are located in places that nurture the open spirit, while others create their own free space within the metropolitan fabric. These artists engage a dialogue concerning freedom, choice and responsibility. And BoxoFFICE is their conduit to a wider audience.</p>
