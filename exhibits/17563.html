<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Sue Scott Gallery is pleased to announce <strong>Do It Yourself</strong>, a solo exhibition of paintings by <strong>Eli Gabriel Halpern</strong> opening June 20 and running through July 27, 2012. This series of paintings envisions a community that governs itself based on a “do it yourself” philosophy and the back-to-the-basics approach that permeates our culture from politics to home décor. The inhabitants build their own homes, fish when they are hungry, and construct elaborate attire out of scraps of carpets, blankets, window shades, and other random detritus.</p>


	<p>An enthusiasm for simpler times prevails, whether it’s the Tea Party’s deification of the Founding Fathers and its obsession with the Constitution, or the voguish trend of making everything out of reclaimed barn wood. Coupled with the dread of various apocalyptic scenarios – nuclear war, financial collapse, or climate change – this longing leads us to the notion that we would all benefit from leading a more rugged, self-sufficient lifestyle. The romanticization of a rustic individualism has always run deep in the American imaginary, but now seems at odds with the entrenched, hands-off, contemporary culture of convenience dependent on modern technology.</p>


	<p>While Halpern’s ideas originate from this overarching narrative prompt, the depicted image on each canvas remains malleable throughout the process. Cobbled together from many disparate parts, his references can be wide-ranging, borrowing techniques and styles not only from the immense reserves of painting’s long history but also from fashion magazines, advertisements, and newspapers. At a certain point, representation of the intended image becomes secondary and competes for primacy with pattern, line, mark making, and compositional balance. Since Halpern’s world is imaginary, figures, objects, and landscapes can be added or removed as needed. The finished painting results from a negotiation between the materiality of the paint and the illusionary possibilities that arise over the course of making the work.</p>


	<p>Everyone from Oscar Wilde to Yukio Mishima to Jim Carrey has had something to say about masks. As much as masks are objects used to hide identity, here, they reveal even more about the subject in terms of personal aesthetics, access to materials, and craftsmanship. The inspiration results from the artist leafing through books of Old Master portraits, relying on the subjects’ clothes and adornments to understand their identity and status. The masks help open areas of the canvas otherwise confined within the known limits and tonal range of the human face, allowing for possibilities of abstraction and expressionism in what is traditionally the focal point of figurative work. Rather than a means of disguise, the homemade masks become a form of self-realization.</p>


	<p>Eli Gabriel Halpern was born in 1986 in Queens, New York. He received his <span class="caps">BFA</span> in 2008 from Cooper Union, graduating with the Pietro and Alfrieda Montana Prize for Excellence in Sculpture. He is a recent <span class="caps">MFA</span> graduate from the School of Visual Arts.</p>


	<p>Sue Scott Gallery is pleased to announce <strong>Martha Diamond: Bright Brush Paintings</strong>, opening in the Project Room, June 20 through July 27, 2012. For this particular grouping of small works, Diamond continues her fascination with structures and architecture, painting abstracted buildings by linking spontaneous and direct strokes of paint, a type of mark that comes from using a particular kind of paintbrush called the Bright. This brush has short hairs with a flat, square end making it ideal for short, hard-edged strokes. Diamond first used the Bright in her childhood, attempting to make a flowing line using poster paint on newsprint to copy a Chinese painting of a horse. Unable to hold enough oil paint, though, the Bright is terrible for the long, sinuous line of a horse’s back.</p>


	<p>Diamond never used that particular brush again until decades later when she learned that two artists she respects liked it. Using this brush again, she decided to make long lines by piecing together short, abbreviated marks. The Bright became a way to “build a line differently with paint, rather than just pulling a line.” In this series of paintings, Diamond synthesizes her strokes into Ivory Black checkerboards, intersecting ovals, exploding stars, pitched rooftops, and two philosophers dancing on a ledge. The additive and direct application of the paint is a vehicle that is both mark and meaning.</p>


	<p>A Manhattan native, Diamond attended Carleton College in Minnesota. Her work is in the permanent collections of numerous institutions including the Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; Miami Art Museum, Miami, FL; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA; Fogg Museum of Art, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; Farnsworth Museum, Rockland, ME; and the North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh, NC; among others. This is her first exhibition with the gallery.</p>
