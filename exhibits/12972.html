<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>As the highway rapidly connected people in new ways, it became a metaphor for modernity, progress and enlightenment. Less acknowledged was the highway’s negative impacts; it divided people from their downtowns, riversides, amenities, and one other. Highways Connect and Divide considers how artists – including Cory Arcangel, Tauba Auerbach, Bureau of Inverse Technology, I/O/D, <span class="caps">JODI</span>, Nam June Paik, Sterling Ruby, and Kerry Tribe – map the systems that impact upon us. Embracing errors and the irrational or redeploying technology, some artists directly abstract from cityscapes, some employ planetary metaphors, while others use abstract forms to figure how systems succeed and fail.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">NAM JUNE PAIK</span> coined the term “electronic super highway” in 1974 to conjure the communications technology landscape of the future. His early video Beatles Electroniques (1966-72) demonstrates his manipulations of a TV broadcast of the Beatles’ A Hard Day’s Night (1964) where he used a magnet to disrupt the televised image, creating semi-abstract and completely abstract images that seem to make visible the electronic connections behind the sound and images of the mass media.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CORY ARCANGEL</span> wittily confounds the relationship between technology and culture. Arcangel’s Timeless Standards / Real Taste installation comprises a series of scans of a Mondrian-like sports-shirt design, and a modular, Coke Zero-filled humidifier. With the prints we experience a transformative journey from the city that Mondrian originally drew inspiration from, to his abstracted paintings, to the appropriated commercial designs, and then finally to Arcangel&#8217;s semi-abstractions; while Real Taste, irrationally repurposes the hi-tech drink as fuel for a contemporary machine whose design concept seems to be a re-imagined 1950s modernity.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">TAUBA AUERBACH</span> explores randomness and precision in the details of systems of patterning and typography. Her Shatter series mixes chance – the shattering effect of broken glass to determine the structure of the image – with a purposefully ordered application of black and white paint. The results appear as clusters of radials, like a display of the nodes of an organic network, or a view of suburbia from the air.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">BUREAU OF INVERSE TECHNOLOGY</span> (BIT) is a group that playfully intervenes with new technologies in order to reveal the fact and fiction of corporate innovation. Their <span class="caps">BIT</span> Plane video (1997) poetically documents the journey of a mini-spy plane as it flies above the headquarters of the biggest computer and technology companies in Silicon Valley &#8211; “into the glittering heartland of the Information Age.”</p>


	<p>I/O/D were pioneers of Internet art in the 1990s. Their I/O/D 4: The Webstalker (1997) uses nascent web crawler technology to map connections across the Internet in real-time, creating constellations of links within a radical browser application that acts as a kind of electron telescope of the hidden data of outlying cyberspace.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">JODI</span> are provocateurs who make art from the modification and disruption of software and operating systems, and the glitches within video-games. In the spirit of Paik’s early TV experiments, their Geo Goo (2008-2011, ongoing) revels in error by radically disrupting Google maps. The platform seems to go mad with flowing icons, sharp zooms in and out, wild pans, and disorienting multiple perspectives in Street View.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">STERLING RUBY</span> explores technologies of control – within psychology, biology, art and architecture &#8211; and mechanisms devised to counter them. He often designs formal systems in order to expose the psychic structures that underlie social phenomena. His collage Existentialists 2 (2010) presents an arrangement of skulls around a circular shape that resembles a primordial mapping of the planetary system. The formation seems to have been long abandoned: it is covered in the graffiti and tagging common to highway underpasses and public parks.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">KERRY TRIBE</span>’s films, videos and installations explore memory, imagination, and subjectivity. Her North is West / South is East: 32 Maps of Los Angeles (2002) is a unique account of a metropolis: random people at LA airport – some who had just flown there for the first time &#8211; were asked to draw their map of the city. The drawings are then placed in a clustered configuration on the gallery wall. As Tribe has said, “Taken together these chance encounters begin to describe a place at once real and imagined.”</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CORY ARCANGEL</span> (1978, Buffalo, NY) lives and works in New York. He holds a Bachelor of Music from Oberlin Conservatory, Oberlin, OH.

	<p><span class="caps">BUREAU OF INVERSE TECHNOLOGY</span> (1991) was formed in Melbourne, Australia by engineer and theorist Natalie Jeremijenko, radio journalist Kate Rich, and artist Daniela Tigani. <span class="caps">BIT</span> was incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1992. <span class="caps">BIT</span> was originally constructed as an anonymous group, a guerilla technical intervention into some of the emergent techniques and technologies of the Information Age. Exhibitions include: Whitney Biennial of American Art, New York (2006); <span class="caps">ZKM</span>, Karlsruhe, Germany (2001); Postmasters, New York (solo)(1999); and the Whitney Biennial of American Art, New York (1997).</p>


	<p>I/O/D (Matthew Fuller, Colin Green, Simon Pope) worked between 1994-1999, producing initially an interactive &#8216;zine with guest writers, musicians and artists that was distributed by floppy disc, usenet and bbs systems. Their work then took on the qualities of software with I/O/D 3, and by I/O/D 4: The Webstalker, arriving at a fully-fledged application for using the world wide web. Selected exhibitions include: New Museum, New York (2005); Hartware MedienKunstVerein, Dortmund, Germany (2002); Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (2001); Walker Art Centre, Minneapolis, MN (1998); <span class="caps">ICA</span>, London (1994).
