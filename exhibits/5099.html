  <p>&#8220;Part of the Permanent Record&#8221; Captures &#8220;Strong Island&#8221; Scene that Formed Public Enemy</p>


	<p>Hip-Hop Activist &#38; Media Assassin Harry Allen&#8217;s &#8220;Part of the Permanent Record: Photos From the Previous Century,&#8221; a show of rare images from a crucial period of hip-hop history.</p>


	<p>&#8220;Part of the Permanent Record&#8221; marks the 20th anniversary of Allen&#8217;s June 1987 debut, not as a photographer but, as a renowned writer and commentator on hip-hop culture. Allen has been published in <span class="caps">VIBE</span>, The Village Voice, The Source, <span class="caps">ESSENCE</span>, Billboard, and other media, while being quoted as an expert in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, on National Public Radio, <span class="caps">MTV</span>, VH-1, and <span class="caps">CNN</span>, and more. Allen has co-produced and narrated features for <span class="caps">BBC</span> Radio, and, since 2003, has hosted and produced a weekly arts radio show, <span class="caps">NONFICTION</span>, for <span class="caps">WBAI</span>-NY / 99.5 FM.</p>


	<p>To even his closest readers, listeners, or colleagues, however, Allen&#8217;s earlier work as a photographer, during his student days at Adelphi University on Long Island, was unknown. It was there, mostly at the student radio station, <span class="caps">WBAU</span>, that Allen became friends with an extraordinary group of like-minded individuals deeply involved with the emerging culture of hip-hop. This circle included virtually all of the young men who would coalesce as Public Enemy and its production unit, the Bomb Squad: Chuck D, Flavor Flav, Hank and Keith Shocklee, Bill Stephney, Terminator X, and Eric &#8220;Vietnam&#8221; Sadler, as well as Andre &#8220;Doctor Dre&#8221; Brown, who would later achieve prominence alongside Ed Lover as the hosts of &#8220;Yo! <span class="caps">MTV</span> Raps.&#8221;</p>


	<p>&#8220;I connected with these guys,&#8221; says Allen, &#8220;because, at a time during which the conventional wisdom was that rap was a `fad&#8217; that would eventually `go away,&#8217; they were the first people I&#8217;d met who, like myself, looked at hip-hop scientifically and took it utterly seriously.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Allen decided that the work these young people were doing <del>- primarily, producing and hosting rap radio shows and live d.j. events -</del> was worth documenting, and he devoted himself to doing so with great flair and attention to detail, roughly between 1983 and 1986. Then, &#8220;because I simply could not figure out how to make a living as a photographer,&#8221; he put his camera down, his photos away, and began to write. By that time, however, he&#8217;d created not only a trove of great pictures of a revolutionary recording group during their incubation period <del>- akin to the Beatles in Hamburg -</del> but of such notables as Run-DMC, Grandmaster Flash &#38; the Furious Five, LL Cool J, Whodini, Dr. Jeckyll &#38; Mr. Hyde, T. La Rock, Stetsasonic, Dick Gregory, Angela Davis, and others.</p>


	<p>This is the first exhibition of Allen&#8217;s photos. Eyejammie is honored to be presenting this work as part of the permanent record preserving hip-hop&#8217;s exuberance, innovation, and spirit.</p>
