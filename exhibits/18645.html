  <p>Carmichael Gallery is pleased to announce Like Father Like Son: <span class="caps">NYC</span>, a retrospective survey of works by renowned Los Angeles-based Chicano father and son photographers, Eriberto and Estevan Oriol. The exhibition debuted at Carmichael Gallery&#8217;s Culver City space in the fall of 2011. The New York iteration will comprise fifteen limited edition black and white, color, silver gelatin and digital c-print from each photographer, including works exhibited in Art in the Streets (April 17 &#8211; August 11) at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MoCA). The exhibition, which offers a dramatic taste of the urban California lifestyle, marks the first showing of the Oriols&#8217; work side by side on the US East Coast.</p>


	<p>About the Artists:</p>


	<p>Eriberto Oriol:
Born in Indio, CA,  Eriberto Oriol grew up in the San Diego neighborhood of Barrio Logan before relocating to Los Angeles, his home now for over three decades. In addition to expanding his internationally recognized portfolio of photographs of LA Latino street life, street art and graffiti, a talent he would later pass down to his son Estevan, he and his wife Angelica Gonzalez-Oriol are enthusiastic, proactive supporters of the local art scene, which led them to curate the first major exhibition of graffiti art in Los Angeles in 1989. In addition to the recognition the Oriols received from the Los Angeles City Council for the show&#8217;s contribution to the community and the praise from numerous media outlets, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles acquired a featured artwork for its permanent collection.</p>


	<p>Estevan Oriol: 
From hip-hop club bouncer to tour manager for Cypress Hill and House of Pain in the late 1980s and early 1990s to the internationally celebrated professional photographer, director and urban lifestyle entrepreneur he is recognized as today, Estevan Oriol&#8217;s talent, fame and success only continue to grow. 1992 saw the beginning of what quickly grew to be an influential relationship with best friend, fellow Soul Assassin associate and now world-famous tattoo artist, Mister Cartoon. Together, they created the increasingly lucrative and high-profile Joker Brand Clothing, just one of Estevan&#8217;s ventures in the clothing industry, which range from Not Guilty, produced with Everlast, and his solo line Scandalous to his eponymous line with Upper Playground. In 1995, however, Eriberto gave his son a camera, and what began as a means of capturing life on tour led to a career that has snapped up images of everyone from gang members and graffiti artists to hip hop stars and Hollywood celebrities.</p>


	<p>About Carmichael Gallery: 
Founded in 2007 by husband and wife team Seth and Elisa Carmichael, Carmichael Gallery focuses on a select group of artists breaking ground in painting, mixed media, photography and sculpture. Their annual program consists of a series of solo and group exhibitions that document the progress of these artists.</p>
