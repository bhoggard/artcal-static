<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>A second solo exhibition with James Paterson featuring painting, drawing and software works that are grown from a decade-long diaristic process. In his work, accumulated libraries of imagery rooted in daily experience revolve around the subjects of digestion, sex, self-critique and skateboarding. Using ink and programming as primary tools, James Paterson continually cycles through meditations on the everyday.</p>


	<p>The Rotten Fruit Tardis, launched online and presented for the first time in a gallery setting, is an animated vehicle that transports viewers between a myriad of dimensions. The  &#8220;Nun Tit Oracle&#8221; and &#8220;New Zealand Vine Collection&#8221; are among many nested worlds synthesized in software by Paterson and displayed as a wall-projection. When explored using The Rotten Fruit Tardis interface, these environments reveal narrative and creatures sketched by hand, all extruded from Paterson&#8217;s drawing archive.</p>


	<p>&#8220;My journey into programming stemmed from a desire to give viewers the opportunity to pilot my work, and feel like they are physically connected with it in a way that they would not be by just looking at a drawing or watching a video,&#8221; says Paterson. &#8220;The desire to transport people into my working instead of just having them observe it from the outside lead me to try and piggy-back the conventions of game design as a way to achieve this visceral immersion.&#8221;</p>


	<p>A screen-based work, 5000 Drawings also plays with the relativity of an observer. Guided inside an expanding and contracting realm of fluid greyscale contours, one&#8217;s gaze can float through multiple viewpoints. Using Paterson&#8217;s first 5000 drawings since the year 2000 as content, this piece becomes a journey through a virtual sketchbook. Bubble letters, calendars, skulls, cars, mutated hands, and flowers drift in a space where visual pathways are left open for each viewer to navigate. The omni-directional interface of this work allows one to scroll through a dense soup of pictures that appear to be cutout and freed from the paper on which they were originally drawn.</p>


	<p>In Paterson&#8217;s work the processes of drawing and programming overlap, feeding into each other. This is perhaps most visible in the graphite wall drawings of the exhibition. Scaled using a projector and drawn by hand on site, these pieces were created using The Objectivity Engine a piece of software authored by Paterson that assists him, as a smash-up tool, in building new visual compositions out of collected imagery. Rooted in the traditions of collage by helping to rearrange a vast digital library of paintings, drawings and animation created over the years, The Objectivity Engine algorithm is rewritten by Paterson every time it is used for a new project. The ink drawings on paper in Harvest were also created using a similar process.</p>


	<p>Collaboration is a strong feature of Paterson&#8217;s work. Sound and music in the exhibition is the result of working with Mark Hardy and Chris Grabowski of K-rAd, an electronic group based in Chicago. Also the twelve paintings in Harvest were created in partnership with artist Jeremy Felker, who used the drawings of Paterson as a point of departure. Continuing the cycle of accumulation and reassembly, these reappear in animated form inside The Rotten Fruit Tardis software.</p>

	<p>Biography &#8211; K-rAd
Based in Chicago, K-rAd is a musical act that includes Chris Grabowski and Mark Hardy. Established in 1996 as an experimental collective, first making music with machines expelled from mid-90s office-land, K-rAd quickly built up the reputation of a completely contained D.I.Y. electronic music unit, pressing their own CD-Rs and playing nightclubs, rock clubs, and underground parties. With more than 40 releases since, K-rAd&#8217;s recent projects include sound and music for films, musicals, hip-hoperas, pizza-making, commercials, driving and chil-lates exercises. <a href="http://www.padK-rAd.com">www.padK-rAd.com</a>.</p>


	<p>Biography &#8211; Jeremy Felker
Visual artist Jeremy Felker (b. 1979. London Ontario, Canada) creates drawings and paintings that explore sustainability, morality, family, sexuality, nutrition and weapons. Felker is presently based in Montreal.</p>
