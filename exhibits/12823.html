<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Causey Contemporary is pleased to announce the return of two photographically based artists to the gallery this March with the opening of Michel Demanche… Corrected to 20/40 and Christine Sciulli&#8230;Tangle. The first exhibition will feature the lush black and white and color photography of Michel Demanche while the second will feature another of Christine Sciulli’s deceptively simple video installations. The exhibitions will run from March 11 &#8211; to April 10, 2011 and will open with a public artist’s reception on March 18th from 6 &#8211; 9 p.m. for both artists. The public is invited to join the artists for the opening reception and or to visit the exhibitions during gallery hours: Mon. 9 a.m. &#8211; 5 p.m, Wed. &#8211; Sat. 11 a.m. &#8211; 7 p.m. or Sun. 12 p.m. &#8211; 6 p.m.</p>


	<p>Michel Demanche….Corrected to 20/40 features the latest series of black and white as well as color photography fresh from the dark room. The exhibition will showcase her more abstracted Icarus series contrasted with her sharply focused Triage&#8230;Tagged Tree series. We have all been told that looking into the sun will burn our eyes and make us blind but Michel wants to ask the question: “does pointing a camera at the sun make it go blind or does it only need a corrected lens?” In these latest series of Ms. Demanche’s some images look too close and see triage while others seem liquefied and blurred but all require 20/40 correction.</p>


	<p>Ms. Demanche’s work from the 2010-11 series have appeared most recently in “Unseen”, at the Arc Gallery of the <span class="caps">MOSI</span> Museum in Tampa, Florida, as a billboard in Grand Rapids Michigan during ArtPrize 2010 and in Tagged an exhibition on art and biodiversity at the Ward Museum in Salisbury, MD. In addition to her photography exhibitions, Ms. Demanche who is also a professor of art at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore is known for a multi media manner of art visualization. Often her work is the result of stories or current events which manifest into photography, mixed media print works, or paintings. These works have found their way into many venues such as the Whitney Museum of American Art, The Houston Museum of Art, The Levinson Collection of Sheppard Pratt Institute, the Women’s Museum and Franklin Furnace. Additionally, her photography won her the grand prize at the Florence Biennale in 2003. Ms. Demanche’s work is also found in the permanent collection of corporations such as E Systems, Frito Lay and Chase Bank. Michell Demanche&#8230;Corrected to 20/40 marks her fourth solo exhibition with Causey Contemporary and her eighth exhibition working with gallery director, Tracy Causey-Jeffery.</p>


	<p>Christine Sciulli….Tangle features the New York City based artist&#8217;s planar video installations which focus on light, refraction across divergent materials, and shadow. Paul D, Miller aka DJ Spooky explains Ms. Sciulli’s work thus, “ Her work consists of intersections of geometry and an intuitive sense of how to use everyday materials to give a sense of “spatialisation” – she plays with how we perceive the world around us in a way that leaves you with a kind of eerie sense of timelessness.”</p>


	<p>These “spatialisations” of Christine Sciulli’s have most recently been seen in exhibitions at AC Institute  (Direct Chapel) The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, at a residency at Dartmouth College’s Hopkins Center and at a residency at <span class="caps">MASS MOCA</span>- both with Phantom Limb. She has exhibited her planar series at Frederieka Taylor Gallery and previously at Causey Contemporary. Currently, she is engaged in a work on 69°S with Phantom Limb which will have its US premier at the Brooklyn Academy of Music during the Next Wave festival 2011. She also has an upcoming exhibition at the Edward Hopper House Art Center in Nyack, NY later this year. At the time of this press release, Ms. Sciulli is still at work on the exhibition for Causey Contemporary.</p>
