  <p><em>Interwoven</em>
December 14, 2012 – March 3, 2013
A Group Exhibition and Grand Opening celebration of Warren Lewis Sotheby’s International Realty Williamsburg</p>


	<p><strong>November 2012, Brooklyn, NY</strong> &#8211; Warren Lewis Sotheby’s International Realty in collaboration with Causey Contemporary Gallery is pleased to present <em>Interwoven</em>, a group exhibition of gallery artists. The opening reception of this salon show will also mark the grand opening of Warren Lewis Sotheby’s International Realty office in their new Williamsburg, Brooklyn location.</p>


	<p><em>Interwoven</em> will unite many different styles, voices and processes representative of the gallery.  The exhibition will feature works by Bahar Behbahani, Nina Carelli, Lauren Dreier, Elise Freda, Kathy Goodell, Howard Gross, Melissa Murray, Norman Mooney, and Carri Skoczek. Interwoven will bring abstraction to mingle with representation; it will allow minimalism to converse with effusive detail; and ultimately it will present the emergence of similarities and differences between these diverse artists.</p>


	<p><strong>Bahar Behbahani</strong> is an Iranian artist who lives and works in both New York and Tehran. Ms. Behbahani has had her paintings, video art and installations featured in numerous locations throughout Europe and Asia, as well as in major cities throughout the U.S.   <strong>Nina Carelli</strong> is originally from Martha’s Vineyard, MA, and currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.

With a background in architecture and material studies, Lauren has taught design courses at The University of Pennsylvania, while exhibiting her work in venues around Philadelphia and New York City. <strong>Elise Freda</strong> has been developing and exhibiting her paintings for over 30 years.  Her works have appeared in both group and solo shows throughout the Eastern United States, as well as in major publications and collections. <strong>Kathy Goodell</strong> is a contemporary artist who works in sculptural objects, installation and drawing. For over 30 years she has exhibited her work in galleries both nationally and internationally, has been featured in several notable art books, and has taught in art institutions across the country. <strong>Howard Gross</strong> began his artistic career in Chicago after attending the Art Institute, and later relocated to New York City in the mid-70’s. His sculpture, drawings and conceptual installations have been shown in many esteemed galleries in New York City amongst other cities. <strong>Melissa Murray</strong> is an emerging artist based in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Her surreal drawings have been featured in solo and group exhibitions in galleries throughout the U.S. and also in Canada. <strong>Norman Mooney</strong> was born in Dublin, Ireland and has been based in Brooklyn for nearly 20 years.
