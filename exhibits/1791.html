  <p>Featuring: Martin Boyce, Bernhard Prinz, and Florian Slotawa</p>


	<p>Curated by Anna-Catharina Gebbers.</p>


	<p>As sculptors and as photographers, Martin Boyce, Bernhard Prinz, and  Florian Slotawa are among the foremost artists of their generation  working in Europe today. This exhibition is the first comprehensive  US show to present the artists&#8217; combined sculptural and photographic  oeuvres. A common feature of these three artists&#8217; work is their use  of furniture and everyday objects as material for their sculptures.  Allusions and direct references to design and art-historical themes  and epochs as well as genre-specific reflections are here combined  into subtle commentaries on the present.</p>


	<p>Martin Boyce&#8217;s sculptures, photographs, texts, and wall works explore  the narrative potential of seemingly familiar, anonymous urban  landscapes. Boyce distills elements from the visual languages of  modern design, film, and architecture. Playing with polar opposites  such as familiarity and distance, inside/outside, or harmony and  tension, he creates within his minimal installations a complex  structure of imagined cultural and social spaces, addressing the  intangible fear, paranoia, and dysfunctionality of contemporary urban  life, at the same time producing an almost nostalgic dissociation. In  
doing so, Boyce provides hints that allow the beholder to generate  his or her own ideas and spaces. The phrase &#8220;Punching Through the  Clouds&#8221; is presented within the grid pattern of four ventilation  grills. They act as a poetic description of the soaring optimism of  the glass tower; the work is dedicated to the skyscraper at a time  that the form has been forever contaminated.</p>


	<p>The photographs and sculptures of Bernhard Prinz create a very  specific ambiguity. His photographic images play enthusiastically  with the camera&#8217;s ability to deceive and capture the fleeting nature  of the constructed and the momentary. They question the  institutionalization of central perspective as well as the belief in  the documentary power of a photographic representation as a proof of  veracity. Instead, photographs show the presence of something that at  the moment of beholding is actually already past, or indeed never  existed in the first place in the way it appears. Prinz&#8217; use of less  &#8220;classical&#8221; sculptural materials such as fabrics, articles of  clothing, everyday objects, and pieces of furniture, lends his  installations and the objects in his photographs the character of  ephemeral sculptures; the white that dominates the works chosen for  the show at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery also creates an atmosphere of  innocence, which is then disrupted by subliminal signs of violence  and decay.</p>


	<p>The works by Florian Slotawa explore the significance, definition and  limitations of sculpture, its fleetingness or durability, and the  border between everyday life and art. Slotawa mostly uses objects  found at the places he works or lives: hotel furniture, museum  displays, objects belonging to the gallerist, as well as his own  personal possessions. Over nine years he built several huge  installations with all of his belongings. This series of works came  to an end when a collector bought all of Slotawa&#8217;s possessions. Today  
these former belongings of the artist are stored and the collector is  contractually forbidden to unpack them. When Slotawa sold them, he  took photographs of every item, categorized by use or formal  similarity. A selection of these photographs are now seen at Tanya  Bonakdar Gallery. Also the concept of the sculpture shown at the  Tanya Bonakdar Gallery originates in Slotawa&#8217;s understanding of  sculpture as performance.  For the show he used the global network of  an international furniture manufacturer, <span class="caps">IKEA</span>, building a high-rise- 
like sculpture with furniture ordered from the local store. Using an  
identical order list, identical sculptures will be built in two  further exhibition venues in Europe and Asia. Together, Slotawa&#8217;s  works investigate the new and strange relationship between the  individual and the material object, or ownership, in the context of  the global market.</p>
