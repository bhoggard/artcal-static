	<p><span class="caps">NEW YORK</span> – <span class="caps">CONTEMPORARY SLAVERY</span>, a project of <span class="caps">SEA</span> (Social Environmental 
Aesthetics) and the second annual <span class="caps">ECOAESTHETIC</span> exhibition, investigates various 
forms of contemporary slavery—from human trafficking and the sex trade; to the 
exploitation of farm and domestic workers, immigrants and prisoners; to sweatshop, 
bonded, and child labor—through a bombardment of images taken by leading 
photojournalists documenting this issue. A symposium will unite scholars, humanitarians 
and activists in dialogue in order to draw critical attention to this under-recognized local 
and international issue.</p>


	<p>According to the United Nations, it is estimated that more than 27 million people are 
enslaved worldwide, “more than double the number of those who were deported in the 
400-year history of the transatlantic slave trade to the Americas.” In his seminal text 
Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy, Kevin Bales, one of the 
world’s pre-eminent experts on modern slavery, defines contemporary slavery as 
distinguished by the low cost of slaves, high profits, surplus of potential slaves, and the 
disposable, short-term as well as hereditary relationships between slaves and slave 
holders/traders. From prison labor in America to sex trafficking in Southeast Asia, and 
child soldiers in Africa, <span class="caps">CONTEMPORARY SLAVERY</span> exposes the horrors of slavery 
that still exist today in all corners of the world.</p>


	<p>Contemporary Slavery exhibition conceived by Papo Colo.</p>


	<p>Exhibition organized by Herb Tam, Associate Curator, Lauren Rosati, Assistant Curator, 
Jeanette Ingberman, and Papo Colo.</p>
