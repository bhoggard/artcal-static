<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Featuring: Jonathan Callan, Echo Eggebrecht, Katharina Fritsch, David Deutsch, Takeshi Makishima, Youngsuk Suh and Etienne Zack.</p>


	<p>Open-ended narratives and idiosyncratic imagery define the paintings and photographs comprising <em>In A Certain Place</em>. Each artist in the exhibition describes a journey through a particular latitude, whether the voyage is a sentimental or voyeuristic. These landscapes are places through which to wander, places whose protagonists, real or implied, escape their interior worlds by traversing mountains, fields and forests.</p>


	<p>Jonathan Callan often alters books, maps or other sources of information, thereby changing its meaning.  His photograph of a cloud-ringed volcano, Ascend, has been perforated so many times that the disintegrating image speaks more eloquently of epic journeys than if left as a documentary fact. Callan lives and works in London and has exhibited frequently with the gallery in New York, as well as in London, Los Angeles, Cologne and Greece. His most recent show was at 
the Mattress Factory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania earlier this year.</p>


	<p>David Deutsch has painted man made structures set in detailed landscapes for some time. He then investigated the inside of the buildings, depicting hundereds of portraits while simultaneously loosening his style. Most recently he has developed a style that is even more fluid and gestural, which he has used to portray aerial-views of suburban houses and backyards. A harsh monocrome pallete, an irregular sense of volume and mass and the odd familiarity of the 
structures cast these familiar structures in a hazy, foreign light. Deutsch lives and works in New York City. He has exhibited widely throughout the United States and has been collected by institutions such as the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>


	<p>Part landscape, part still life, Echo Eggebrecht&#8217;s paintings are quiet stages whose characters have either just left or are about to return. Evidence of their leisure activities are strewn about empty fields and forests. Each badminton racquet, carved initial and paper snowflake is rendered in minute detail, suggesting longing and intense memory. Her canvases are characterized by intricate patterns, one point perspective and muted colors. These structures belie the intensity of her narratives, which are only suggested. Eggebrecht is finishing her M.F.A. at Hunter College in New York City and will have her solo debut with the gallery in the fall of 2006.</p>


	<p>Katharina Fritsch&#8217;s sculptural practice questions the reality of objects, figures and motifs derived from mythology or literature. She uses scale, color, and placement to transform ordinary subjects into icons, invested with a richer meaning. Looking through her sculpture from 1979, Dark Green Tunnel, &#8220;gives the impression of a long, potentially infinite tunnel,&#8221; as described in her catalog raisonn√©. Fritsch lives and works in Germany. She has had a long career, 
exhibiting internationally.</p>


	<p>Takeshi Makishima&#8217;s paintings orchestrate elaborate scenes of dreamy exploration. His protagonists are as likely to encounter picket fences and mountain ranges as well as abstract shapes, stuffed animals, skulls, lost possessions and invasive vegetation. Each slightly bizarre scene has its own imagery, as each painting is an exploration into a foreign night time world. Takeshi Makishima was born in Japan but lives in Dusseldorf, Germany. This exhibition marks his first participation in a group show in New York.</p>


	<p>Youngsuk Suh photographs National Parks in Hawaii and Utah as well as the parks&#8217; visitors, wandering about, enjoying nature&#8217;s majesty while contemplating its restorative power. Each negative records visitors in different stances which are then digitally dropped in to the landscapes by Suh. Thus, the images become a record of individual experiences as opposed to the photographers&#8217; omnipotent eye. These tourists are not on a trip of discovery. They are as lost in their own civilized world as they are in the natural one. Youngsuk Suh lives in Boston and received his M.F.A. from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</p>


	<p>Etienne Zack paints from photographs of his studio surroundings to depict remnants of bricolage or barbeque, piles of used tools and supplies, detritus and rubble. Each of these quotidian objects is rendered in wide swaths of murky color, occasionally interjected by acidic green or yellow. The marks coalece from brushstoke to representation and back again. Each diorama is imbued with a greater significance, as though these domestic characters are in wordless 
conversation with one another. Zack lives in Vancouver, British Columbia and has exhibited throughout Canada. Neo Rausch selected him for inclusion in East International at the Norwich Gallery, Norwich, Norfolk, England.</p>
