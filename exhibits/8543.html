  <p>The <span class="caps">DUDION LEVERS</span> is the fruit of the collaboration between the artist, musician, and &#8220;Director of Behavior&#8221; Michael Portnoy and Oliver Suddenâ€”engineer, tinkerer, and former opera singer, as well as the nephew of the famous French writer Boris Vian. A long time admirer of Boris Vian, fascinated by Vian&#8217;s visionary imagery, and his activities within the College of Pataphysics, Portnoy began to exchange thoughts and comments with Sudden on his uncle&#8217;s inventions after meeting in Europe last year. A few months ago, Oliver Sudden discovered in Vian&#8217;s archives sketches for a vocal &#8220;power tool&#8221; that would transform the voice into a massive orchestral unisound, which is then imprinted upon or inscribed on objects, or in some cases transforms or forms objects in the vicinity. The &#8220;brain&#8221; of this instrument was &#8220;the dudion levers&#8221;, a constellation of resonating glyphs. Sudden, once a famous tenor in the 70&#8217;s (under a different name) before a rare throat condition ended his career, has lived in anonymity and seclusion in Brittany, running a small shop which repairs analog synthesizers. He constructed an interpretation of <span class="caps">THE INSTRUMENT</span> and asked Michael Portnoy to give it his voice and to contribute conceptually in the modernization of the instrument&#8217;s sound and functionality.</p>


	<p>The central piece of the show will be the first time exhibition and public use of <span class="caps">THE INSTRUMENT</span>, with which Michael Portnoy will perform the night of the opening. Portnoy will expose a series of sculptures which are assemblages of objects featuring as central elements in proposed art projects/performances/films etc. (Ex.: The dotted lines in the middle of the road are covered in cinnamon and upholstered with white leather. The alligator is a mile away, by the window. Packet of cinnamon, white leather, red Lacoste polo shirt, mother-of-pearl, 2008.) These &#8220;proposals&#8221; are expressed gutturally by Portnoy through <span class="caps">THE INSTRUMENT</span> and transformed into songs which are inscribed upon each assemblage in mother-of-pearl.</p>


	<p>Michael Portnoy&#8217;s diverse practice spans meta-functional sculpture, dance-theater, fascist socials, experimental stand-up, prog-operatic spectacle, aerobic feeding chambers, and Icelandic cockroach porn. Portnoy&#8217;s long-standing investigation of social exchange, and the rules of communication and play, is currently conducted through a series of abstract gambling tables, drawing on gambling&#8217;s roots in ritual and divination. His underground <em>Casino Ilinx</em> was just presented at SculptureCenter in the summer of 2008. <span class="caps">PS1</span>/Moma, Art Unlimited Basel, The Kitchen and Kunsthalle Basel are among the many international museums and art spaces who&#8217;ve featured his provocative, unpredictable work.</p>


	<p>Oliver Sudden is a specialist in the first generation of analog synthesizers (Synket, Buchla, Moog, Synthi 100, <span class="caps">ARP 2600</span>, Putney, ElectroComp 400, Aries 300, etc.) His shop in Brittany is one of the few in the region that is equipped to upkeep and repair these machines. Sudden has developed a series of &#8220;perversions&#8221; of these models for his personal use. He is a skilled welder, electrical engineer, and self-taught malacologist and has invented several spat racks and a maturation tank for the cultivation of oysters.</p>
