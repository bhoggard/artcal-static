	<p>The Red House is pleased to present a group show, Uneasy Pleasure. The works exhibited by five artists encompass a range of photographic imagery and video display, bringing together both emerging and established artists having national and international careers. Collectively, they work within common concepts that are aligned with the sublime. Each artist touches upon elements of awe and wonder, lightness and darkness, and the uneasy pleasure of transcendence. Equating emotion and aesthetics, this collection of work presents a contemporary appreciation of Romanticism. Featured artists: Brigitte Lustenberger, Sherry Griffin, Jim Ramer, William Lamson, and Meredith Allen.</p>


	<p>The Red House is a pop-up gallery in the East Village. Supported by Swiss actress Linda Geiser for over 35 years, the Red House has hosted writers, visual artists, musicians, filmmakers, dancers and directors. As a &#8220;living studio&#8221;, the resident artists create, sleep, eat and play on the premises &#8211; bolstering a spirited environment for all who participate or visit. Today the Red House hosts three studios and apartments for Swiss artists. This unique place with a special history has inspired this exhibition curated by artists Sherry Griffin and Brigitte Lustenberger.</p>
