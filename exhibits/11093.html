  <p><strong>Forever &#38; Today, Inc.</strong> announces the newly commissioned installation <em>SD Studio Dynamics 57UMSTRA1 &#8220;Strata #1,&#8221; Unmounted, 5&#215;7</em>, 2010, a first-time collaboration between New York artists <strong>Heather Rowe</strong> and <strong>Kevin Zucker</strong>. An artists&#8217; talk about the project will take place on Wednesday, April 7, to attend, please <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="81f3f2f7f1c1e7eef3e4f7e4f3e0efe5f5eee5e0f8afeef3e6af">[email&#160;protected]</a></p>


	<p>As part of Forever &#38; Today’s curatorial mission to commission new work by cutting-edge contemporary artists and provide an opportunity to realize a challenging new project, this collaboration expands the artists’ recognized practices and engages a diverse public within the context of New York’s Lower East Side/Chinatown.</p>


	<p><em>SD Studio Dynamics 57UMSTRA1 &#8220;Strata #1,&#8221; Unmounted, 5&#215;7</em> takes its name from a black-and-white starburst effect studio backdrop incorporated into a site-specific series of three freestanding wooden shelving structures. Serving as the primary focus of the installation, the shelving apparatus is replete with angled panels, cut-glass mirrored panes, and fragmented sheer black scrim that absorb, reflect, and refract a series of theatrical lighting effects replicating the studio backdrop.</p>


	<p>Additionally, elements from the original 1927 Loew’s Canal Theater’s archival architectural renderings are incorporated into the installation. Situated directly across the street from Forever &#38; Today, Inc., the elaborate Spanish Baroque façade of this once grand movie palace, shuttered since the late-1970s, merely hints at its original interior grandeur.</p>


	<p>Rowe and Zucker’s installation may be seen as a fantasy reconstruction (based on publicly available information) of the presently closed and inaccessible theater that simultaneously references its history and current status as a storage space. The dramatic lighting, predominantly black-and-white palette, and sense of fragmentation, reinforces the artists’ aesthetic homage to early film and to the ways in which architecture and movies are experienced.</p>


	<p>These cinematic effects are deployed back on themselves in a self-reflexive manner, creating a melodramatic situation whose subject becomes the mechanisms of its own presentation. This reflects both artists’ longstanding interest in the operations of special effects and the tension between pictorial illusion and physical space. Rowe’s sculpture often combines references from films with architectural details and Zucker’s work has explored, primarily through painting, imagery related to the archiving, storage, and display of curated material, frequently including visual resources from research projects.</p>


	<p><strong>Heather Rowe</strong> (b. 1970, New Haven, CT) lives and works in New York City and received her <span class="caps">MFA</span> in 2001 from Columbia University, School of the Arts. Rowe recently presented new site-specific commissions for the Indianapolis Museum of Art, Indianapolis, Indiana (2010) and <span class="caps">UMMA</span>/University of Michigan Museum of Art, Ann Arbor, Michigan (2010), and her upcoming solo projects include The Public Art Fund, New York (2010). In 2008, her work was featured in the Whitney Biennial. Other select group exhibitions include: La Calmeleterie, Nazelles-Négron, France (2009); P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, Long Island City, New York (2009); Art in General, New York (2007); Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, New York (2007); White Columns, New York (2006); and Artists Space, New York (2005). Rowe is represented by and has presented one-person exhibitions at Galerie Zink, Munich/Berlin (2009) and D&#8217;Amelio Terras, New York (2006, 2007). She has taught and served as a visiting critic, and her work has been written about in numerous international publications such as Artforum, Art in America, Art Monthly, ArtNews, ArtReview, Flash Art, Frieze, Modern Painters, The Nation, The New Yorker, The New York Times, and Time.</p>
