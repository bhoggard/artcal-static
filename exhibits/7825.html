  <p>VertexList has the pleasure to present “New Blood”, a group exhibition which &#8220;probes the empty, vacant, and vacuous nature of a world full of things where perception and the direct experience of “real-life” are blurred by the dense atmosphere of media, consumption, and entertainment.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Feturing video, new media and installations by Nao Bustamante, Sasha Dela, Sergio De La Torre, Double Happiness, Sujin Lee, Jeanne Verdoux and Lance Wakeling</p>


	<p>Curated by Charles Beronio.</p>


	<p>&#8220;New Blood&#8221; marks a turning point at vertexList and the beginning of a new 5-year plan of growth and development. The work in the exhibition looks back several years through the different subjective lenses of the artists and also considers our current cultural landscape. The artists of New Blood examine their experiences and surroundings to engage and embrace the world we live in to reveal its’ submerged and hidden meanings and narratives. Examining the banal, absurd, and sublime nature of the overlooked, day-to-day surface manifestations of our consumerized culture and its deeper (il)logic, inner structure, and architecture&#8212;– New Blood reveals the forces at play in the spaces and places we inhabit and reside in as well as the concealed range of emotional experiences that occur in these settings– from boredom, loneliness, and longing, to desire, love, and violence (both bodily and economic). The exhibition probes the empty, vacant, and vacuous nature of a world full of things where perception and the direct experience of “real-life” are blurred by the dense atmosphere of media, consumption, and entertainment.
