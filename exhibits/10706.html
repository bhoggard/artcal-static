  <p>The Taller Boricua is pleased to announce four solo exhibitions by: Keith O. Anderson, Melissa A. Calderon, William Coronado &#38; Chanika Svetvilas</p>


	<p>Curated by Marcos Dimas and Christine Licata</p>


	<p>Keith O. Anderson creates site-specific installations and objects that transform unassuming materials such as raisins, cotton puffs, black-eyed peas, clothespins and straight pins into an unconventional visual vocabulary of social and political critique and commentary. In “<em>Matière Première</em> / Raw Material,” Anderson’s work reveals the transitory relationships and nature of everyday items and symbols, offering unexpected meanings and insights into the world around us.</p>


	<p>In “Osmosis,” Melissa A. Calderon incorporates installation, photography and sculpture to explore the concepts of multicultural identity and gender. Her work examines the stereotypes and the controversial symbols of the transnational Latino experience. Calderon integrates the duality present in acculturation by paying homage to the significant contributions and traditions of Latino culture, as well as challenging the negative, commercialized ideologies that have become synonymous with it.</p>


	<p>In William Coronado’s paintings, flesh becomes the medium through which the boundaries between the metaphysical and the physical aspects of human existence are explored. At once gestural and corporeal, his exhibition “Skin Deep” simultaneously embodies the psychology of existence and the biology of being. Through a combination of distortion and representation, Coronado challenges the viewer to experience separate realities as well as reexamine the broader issues of identity and gender.</p>


	<p>Chanika Svetvilas’ site-specific installation “Import / Export,” uses familiar commercial and domestic objects and materials such as toy soldiers, rubber gloves and plastic, plaid shopping bags as metaphors to transcribe the cultural and social challenges within migration and immigration. Her multidisciplinary work also includes layers of international corporate logos merged with global branding. These iconic, self-referential symbols reveal the paradoxical relationships between consumerism, commodities, transculturation and ultimately, globalization.</p>


	<p>Keith O. Anderson is a sculptor, photographer, installation and multi-media artist based in New York City. His work has been exhibited internationally and in the United States including I Space (Chicago), Chicago Cultural Center, Galerie Christine Marquet de Vasselot (Paris), Rush Arts Gallery (New York), Power House Memphis, Longwood Art Gallery (New York), Evanston Art Center, Riverside Art Center, Crooked Tree Arts Center (Petoskey, Michigan), Klein Arts Works (Chicago), 16th Evanston and Vicinity Biennial, 44th Salon Montrouge, Art Junction International (Nice), Galerie du Jour, Agnès b., (Paris) and the <span class="caps">FIAC</span> International Art Fair (Paris). In 2008, Anderson was awarded the Urban Artist Initiative /NYC Fellowship.</p>


	<p>Melissa A. Calderon incorporates installation, photography, sculpture and video in her work. She received her B.A. in Art History from <span class="caps">CUNY</span> Lehman College and lives and works in the Bronx, New York City. Calderon has exhibited at El Museo del Barrio (New York), The Portland Museum of Art, Affirmation Arts (New York), <span class="caps">BBBP</span> / Bronx Blue Bedroom Project (New York), Portland Museum of Art Biennial, Haven Arts Space (Bronx), Arte Americas (Fresno), Longwood Arts Project (New York) and The Bronx Museum of the Arts (New York).</p>

His work has been published in numerous journals and periodicals including New American Paintings, Oranges and Sardines, The Encyclopedia Latina and The Gothic Times. Coronado is currently a professor at the Cicely Tyson School of Performing and Fine Arts.</p>
