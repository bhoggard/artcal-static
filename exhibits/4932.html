  <p>M.Y. <span class="caps">ART PROSPECTS</span> is pleased to present &#8220;Loaded&#8221;, a group exhibition curated by New York-based artist Tom Snelgrove , opening Thursday, June 28, and continuing through Saturday, July 28, 2007. The six featured artists individually address issues related to cultural-stimuli-overload. As a result of contemporary phenomena such as rapid advancements in technology, coupled with a broad, insatiable appetite for entertainment and commercial profit, Andrew Chan, Daniel Davidson, Priscila De Carvalho, Alexis Duque, Carey Maxon and Jon Rappleye have found an exceptionally rich terrain to investigate.</p>


	<p>Andrew Chan&#8217;s work involves subject matter that ranges from commentary on rampant consumerism, to the underlying violence and abyss facing Western and American culture, to our fascination with food and eating. His drawings address entropy and its consequent cycle of construction and destruction through representations of people, objects, cities, the body politic and physical space. These elements work in unison to tell a detailed story that can be both compelling and disturbing.</p>


	<p>Daniel Davidson&#8217;s paintings and drawings are a complicated fusion of hybrid characters, spaces and styles. The figures that populate his work are often self-portrait caricatures of an infinite variety of possible selves. Often employing the comic or the grotesque, these paintings are multiple and fractured looking for a cobbled identity. Some of Davidson&#8217;s work employs a riff on well known historical artworks, simultaneously poking fun at the sober idea behind them as well as contemporary issues such as unbridled American self-indulgence.</p>


	<p>Priscila De Carvalho creates installations representing the complex network of the shantytowns in modern-day Brazil. Her work primarily deals with a form of social life in the slums that have become the mainstream culture in her native country. As an observer of her own personal experiences living in America and growing up in Brazil, much of De Carvalho&#8217;s work involves a focus on the American consumer culture, broad-reaching gay and lesbian cultures, and the distinction between childhood and adult world.</p>


	<p>Alexis Duque&#8217;s paintings address &#8220;comunas&#8221; or &#8220;favelas&#8221;, as a multifaceted social phenomenon characteristic of Latin American cities. His work deals with the chaotic and unavoidable processes of urbanization caused by rural and international migrations that form poverty ghettos surrounding these cities.</p>


	<p>Carey Maxon&#8217;s work addresses the elaborate internal affects of a society barraged with stimuli. Her non-linear pieces are influenced by architectural shapes around us, the movements of other people, quick thoughts, feelings and impulses. Maxon&#8217;s detailed work reflects her interest in every fleeting instant and therefore creates work which bombards her as does each moment.</p>


	<p>Jon Rappleye&#8217;s work blurs the line between organic and manmade. Using the symmetry of nature as a multifarious blueprint, he explores the intricate boundaries of reality versus artifice. The surface of is pieces are populated with many fantastic creatures whose ego and sexual desires are played out within the landscape of a childhood nightmare. With this work he investigates a multitude of subjects such as folklore, myth and &#8220;supernature&#8221;.</p>
