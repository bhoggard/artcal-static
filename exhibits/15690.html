  <p>Viewing Hours: 10am-6pm</p>


	<p>Tai Hwa Goh recently is interested in the irony and the contrast
between fragility of prints on paper and concrete architectural
element as vulnerable human being and monumental layers of his
history. Window, one of the elements of architecture with its effects
of transparency and reflection, seems to exemplify the notions of
fragility and immateriality. It speaks of the strength of the material
architectural, structural and industrial, at once delicate shell and
protective casing. Chashama’s windows the interesting show place for
her works as boundary of these two contrast aspects, which is feeble
but also strong, and isolated but also crossed-over.</p>


	<p>Goh’s hand waxed prints which has been created by traditional
printmaking techniques is being mounted onto walls, floor, ceiling,
and windows (The hand waxing process gives the prints transparency so
image can be viewed from outside and inside onto windows). Through the
process of folding, cutting, flipping and overlapping the prints, the
images are gradually transformed and grow into space questioning about
the concept of the reproduction of prints. Its source is two
dimensional yet it breaks out into a three dimensional sculptural
existence. Crossing over the limit of two or three dimensional
understanding, beyond the plane dimensions to find suitable materials
in the existing space, her irregular, unfixed, mutable, and continuous
installation opens the possibility of multiple interpretations about
human being, and art as well, which should be crossing over the edge
of the boundary.</p>


	<p>Tai Hwa Goh, an artist working with printmaking and paper
installation, was born in Seoul, Korea, where she spent her childhood
years through college.</p>


	<p>Goh received a <span class="caps">MFA</span> degree at the University of Maryland in 2004
specializing in printmaking and sculpture. She also received another
<span class="caps">MFA</span> in printmaking at Seoul National University in Korea back in 2000.
Goh had over 10 solo exhibitions and numerous group shows at leading
galleries, such as <span class="caps">IPCNY</span> (NY), Carriage House (Islip Museum, NY),
Flashpoint Gallery (DC), Gallery Aferro(NJ), A.I.R Gallery(NY),
Arlington Arts Center (VA), School33 (MD), Space Gallery (Cleveland,
OH), and the Consular Office at Embassy of Korea (DC and NY). She was
awarded many grants and residencies from Evergreen Museum &#38;
Library(MD), Vermont Studio Center (NY), Lower East Side Print Shop
(NY), DC Commissions on the Arts Humanities and Prince George&#8217;s Art
Council (MD). Her works are included in the collection of the DC City
Hall, Lower East Side Print Shop and University of Maryland. Goh
creates artwork in which an innovative integrated medium of
printmaking is put together to create a new art form that is symbolic
and physical. Its source is two dimensional yet it breaks out into a
three dimensional sculptural existence. Layering printed Korean paper
(Soon-ji) act as a representational of the human body, life events and
its traced experience… the waxed paper creates a delicate translucency
allowing through vibration of imagery.</p>
