  <p>An AC Institute [Direct Chapel] presents four new exhibitions:</p>


	<p>Roma Pas: Early Picture
Selin Kocagöncü: Teacher’s Dilemma
Ruben Aubrecht: Please Be Patient
Jeffrey Cyphers Wright: The Good Outlaw</p>


	<p>Roma Pas: Early Picture
Early Picture is Roma Pas’ semi-spatial remake of an early picture by Auguste Rosalie Bisson depicting a snow expedition on the Mont-Blanc (1861). The first steps in the snow and on the mountain also symbolize the first steps in photography.  The relief and the walls are covered with the backsides of photo paper, reading &#8216;Kodak Xtralife, Kodak Xtralife, Kodak Xtralife&#8230;&#8217; The silhouettes of the climbers are replaced by silhouettes of the artist.  Says Pas, “My works are lyrical, archetypical reinterpretations of media signals…Although I often use flash programming, computer milling, lasering and 3D modeling this mainly leads to &#8220;unplugged&#8221; versions of digital art: making a connection between the high tech possibilities that we have and the low tech that we are ourselves.”

	<p>Selin Kocagöncü: Teacher’s Dilemma
Selin Kocagöncü composes game-like structures which are at times socially-engaged and at other times particularly personal. Teacher&#8217;s Dilemma is a cathartic drinking game dealing primarily with failure of communication.”</p>


	<p>Ruben Aubrecht: Please Be Patient
Loading&#8230; on the standard blue screen background &#8230; Loading&#8230; the screen displays a promise to play a <span class="caps">DVD</span>, shortly. Loading&#8230; theinfinite loop of never-ending loading processes in the video  Please be Patient(2009) represents Ruben Aubrecht‘s tenacious attempt to keep re-exploring the boundaries of the medium of video within the boundaries of the screen on which it is generally shown. In his video loops, the artist uses humorous and enlightening insights to attack the idea of the Black Box (…) Aubrecht’s approach does notfocus on the specific elements of this form of  expression, with a view to asserting their autonomy; on the contrary, he confronts the gravity of a reflexive artistic treatment of the medium with a quick-witted matter-of-factness.

	<p>Jeff C. Wright: The Good Outlaw
The Good Outlaw proposes a dialogue in the form of a graffiti, stencil and collage mural that will employ the tools of street art. Poet and artist Jeffrey Cyphers Wright will begin the piece, focusing on self-determination and resistance. Viewers will be invited to draw and write on the wall and add their marks, statements and tags in an overall environment that is &#8220;interactive, participatory and democratic&#8221; to quote the philosopher Boris Groys <del>- a vital art that is outside the artmarket, outside the affadavits afforded by the government /university grant fellowship factories or the museum / cathedral inner circle of curatorial backslapping -</del> art that robs from the snobs and gives back to a community of restless rebels. Viewers will be invited to draw and write on the wall and add their marks and tags to Wright&#8217;s graphic extravaganza.</p>
