<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Foxy Production presents Solar Set, a group exhibition featuring works by Michael Bell-Smith, Olga Chernysheva, Tony Labat, Takeshi Murata, and Siebren Versteeg. Solar Set refers to a box work by Joseph Cornell from 1958, where the artist collected and arranged solar statistics, spherical objects, and images of the sun, among other elements, to create an idiosyncratic universe in miniature. The exhibition explores the ways in which images, objects or events are collected and reconfigured within conceptually rich and critically resonant visual systems. Using diverse means, the works take popular cultural forms as their starting point to forge imaginative connections, evocative images, and unexpected metaphors.</p>


	<p>Michael Bell-Smith mixes original and appropriated imagery to produce iconographic, conceptual videos, installations, and prints. For Solar Set, he presents digitally rendered line tracings from the film Tron (1982), known for its break-through blend of live action and computer generated imagery. Depicting a cityscape, cyberspace, and workplace cubicles, he investigates the representation of space and perspective through a reinterpretation of virtual locations.</p>


	<p>Olga Chernysheva&#8217;s films and photographs wryly scrutinize the post-Soviet experience. Her video March (2005) observes the pomp and absurdity of a nationalist celebration that includes boy guards, cheerleading pom-pom girls, and assorted local dignitaries in a searing and at times hilarious expos√© of the ornamentation of power. It is Chernysheva&#8217;s almost seamless mediation of the events recorded that gives the work its subversive power.</p>


	<p>Tony Labat&#8217;s diverse practice, including video, painting, installation, sculpture and performance, repurposes cultural artifacts to produce provocative statements about contemporary experience. His Frankenstein Series (2007) comprises digital prints on canvas of earlier works that were constructed from found photographs. His remastered images of a Sikh Elvis, a comical Karl Marx, and an Yves Klein model, with their layering of appropriation upon appropriation, astutely examine the process of image production.</p>


	<p>Takeshi Murata&#8217;s videos push definitions of figuration and abstraction to the limits. Using the digital pixel as his building block, he dissolves and re-constructs found film footage to produce compelling, almost sculptural moving images. His Untitled (Pink Dot) (2007) reconfigures ultra-violent action movie footage: at times he seems to aestheticize the violence with rhapsodic flowing fluorescent colors, while at others he creates a deep sense of foreboding with dark, leaden movements and a convulsive, blinking pink dot.</p>


	<p>Siebren Versteeg explores visual processes: he reprograms popular software, corporate design, and internet functionality with dynamic, often intricate results. For Solar Set, he has produced a site-specific wall montage of images randomly downloaded from Flicker, the online photo-library. This digital collage is itself constructed from hundreds of small photographs assembled like a huge jigsaw puzzle. He also presents a series of black and white prints, generated from the results of a Google image search of the word &#8220;Satan&#8221; that have been fed into a drawing program.</p>
