<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p><span class="caps">THIERRY GOLDBERG PROJECTS</span> is pleased to present Cut, a group show of video, collage, and installation, with works by Keren Cytter, Jonathan Hartshorn, Anna Parkina, and Meredyth Sparks.</p>


	<p>Cut offers a look into the mobility of significance, meaning, and self-definition through popular culture. Cut and the various meanings of the word serve as the common denominator for the show &#8211; the threshold between reality and fiction in the language of cinema; the essence of collage in the language of art, and the harbinger of pain in the language of the body.</p>


	<p>Keren Cytter&#8217;s Repulsion, a multi-channel video inspired by Roman Polanski&#8217;s first English film of the same title conveys a mood of suspense through three varied scenarios. As a triptych running in tandem, Cytter references Doug Aitken&#8217;s investigations into fragmented and simultaneous narration with a touch of &#8216;Hitchcock Presents&#8217;. Surrounded and disoriented by video, the viewer is held captive. The perceptual task at hand, then, is that of locating the self-immersed in a remake of sorts. Appropriated, fragmented, and relational, Cytter addresses narrative structure and meaning through a collage-like mobility.</p>


	<p>Jonathan Hartshorn maps out a tangle of desultory associations with drawings, photos, and objects (found and of his own creation). His wall installations are mini-exhibitions, seemingly biographical, which in their intricacy create an introverted tautology. All in all, his work points to a world of relational meaning, collaged, mobile, re-contextualized with each component gaining significance in proximity to other works.</p>


	<p>In a series of collages cum self-portraits cum performance art, Anna Parkina investigates the Self in relation to the culture of spectacle. Her aesthetic embodies Soviet design, 80&#8217;s computer graphics, and screen-printing, which together provide an ironic anachronism relevant in a common desire to create ulterior social orders.</p>


	<p>Meredyth Sparks&#8217; collages allude to the geometry of Kasimir Malevich and the iconography of Gerhard Richter. In her recent work Sparks utilizes the image of Annie Beatrice Henry, the second woman in the history of Louisiana to be electrocuted by the state. Her head held high for a mug shot eerily becomes a mask for the figure behind her. Via repetition and surface cutouts, Sparks&#8217; sense of collage is dark, even, and nihilistic in its negation and monotony &#8211; a tone which Cut accepts in all its anxiety and irony.</p>


	<p>Keren Cytter lives and works in Berlin. Her work is currently on view in a solo exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art (MOMUK), Vienna Austria. Her videos were also exhibited in The Lyon Biennial, The Moscow biennial, and in solo exhibitions at Kust-Werke Berlin, Kunsthalle Zurich and at the Frankfurter Kunstverein. She will also be included in &#8216;Television Delivers People&#8217;, which opens next month at The Whitney Museum. Jonathan Hartshorn lives and works in New York. His work has been exhibited at <span class="caps">PS1</span> MoMA, New York; Roberts &#38; Tilton, Los Angeles; and at Feature Inc., New York. Anna Parkina lives and works in Moscow. Her work has been exhibited at <span class="caps">COMA</span>, Berlin (solo); HaswellEdiger, New York (solo); Daniel Hug, Los Angeles; and Michael Janssen, Cologne. Meredyth Sparks lives and works in New York. Her work has been exhibited at The Moscow Biennial; <span class="caps">PS1</span> MoMA, New York; The Kitchen, New York; Galerie Frank Elbaz, Paris (solo); Elizabeth Dee, New York; and Spruth Magers Lee, London.</p>
