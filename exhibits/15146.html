<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>In 2001 brothers Ray and Dave Potes began Hamburger Eyes, an independent publishing imprint producing limited edition zines and a blind bound quarterly comprised entirely of black and white photography, aka “The Most Epic Magazine Ever.” Regular contributors included Ray and Dave Potes, Stefan Simikich and Ted Pushinsky. Submissions continued to evolve over the years and have included the work of Ari Macropolis, Barry McGee, Ed Templeton, as well as American photo giants such as Bill Owen and Bill Burke.</p>


	<p>Hamburger Eyes has created a cult like following since it’s beginning stages. Through the 2010 Powerhouse publication Hamburger Eyes: Inside Burgerworld, involvement with the Levi’s Photography Workshops, and a range of exhibits globally, their curatorial vision has reached a vast and international audience. It has been stated, “documentary street photography should not look this good.” The Inferno is a finely curated cross section of the established, the up and coming, east coast, west coast and international photographers. As an accompaniMent to the body of work in the The Inferno, each photographer will have an individual zine published by King Hamburger Eyes.  Ed. Varie will be offering a collector’s edition poster in very limited quantities.</p>


	<p>&#8212;Patrick Griffin received his <span class="caps">BFA</span> from the California College of the Arts and has shown extensively in the US and internationally at galleries such as The Hole, The Journal Gallery, Deitch Projects Design District in Miami, O.H.W.O.W., and Colette in Paris. Dave Potes, co-founder of Hamburger Eyes alongside brother Ray Potes, continues to focus on the imprint King Hamburger Eyes publishing limited edition zines and books.  Dave’s photos have been printed in numerous magazines, various photo books, t-shirts, shoes, totes, and exhibited in galleries in San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Toronto. Lele Saveri was born in Rome and studied photography in London. Currently based in New York he collaborates with various publications, including Apartamento, D della Repubblica, Rivista Studio, Rolling Stone, Sang Bleu, L’Uomo Vogue, Vice. Yuri Shibuya was born in Tokyo and studied at the Musashino Art University.  Her work has been published in Paper, Dune, Tokion, Warp Japan, and the New York Times. She has collaborated with brands such as Zoo York, Billabong and Volcom. Alessandro Zuek Simonetti graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice in 2001 and continued on to be a professor of Photography at The Institute of Arts in Padova, Italy. His work has been published in magazines such as Rolling Stone, GQ, Warp Magazine, Vice. Andrea Sonnenberg is a self-taught photographer born, raised and currently living San Francisco. She was recently included in Los Angeles <span class="caps">MOCA</span> show “Art In The Streets”.  Along with her debut in New York, she is working on her first solo show set for her hometown SF later this year. Lisa Weiss graduated in 2010 from the San Francisco Art Institute with a <span class="caps">BFA</span> in photography. Her zine “Holy Land,” a collection of photos from the Israel and Egypt, was published by King Hamburger Eyes in 2010.</p>


	<p>The Inferno will be on view at Ed. Varie through November 13, 2011. Please check the website for updated gallery hours, or contact the gallery director to set up and appointment.</p>
