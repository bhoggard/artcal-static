  <p>Y Gallery is pleased to present &#8220;TWO <span class="caps">TO DOMINATE</span>&#8221;, a two person exhibition by Mexican artist Blanka Amezkua and Korean artist Eunah Kim curated by Cecilia Jurado. For this exhibition both artists address ideas of powerful women, women with extraordinary physical attributes. Amezkua goes for the stereotypically hip, ultra sexy and dramatic woman,  Kim has chosen to showcase the happy healthy one.</p>


	<p>Since her early work, Eunah Kim has focused on the ambivalence of medicine, the need for cure for the body and the experimentation in the will to get more knowledge about our unseen interiors. Also, she has investigated death and spiritual acts around it. Last year, the artist was diagnosed with lung cancer, a fact that changed her work dramatically. She thought her deep research had coincided with her real life, as dark as this can sound. For her new project she wanted to produce as many vibrant and lively works as she could to keep herself in good health. Thus she produced a group of exquisite objects with human organs representing what looks like a sect of healthy superwomen. Flags, medallions, a beauty queen with happy lungs and more. Like an equation, health=happiness, success.</p>


	<p>In her way, Blanka Amezkua has being reusing mass media imagery from her native Mexico. For some of her work she takes representations of women in erotic comic books, usually produced for a male audience, and replaces them with objects that are more related with to domestic, housewife activities such as embroidering and collecting baroquely framed family portraits.  This time she presents a group of manipulated comic covers with sexy women in tragic scenes, where the drama gives even more sex appeal to the protagonists. Also the artist presents a big collection of women&#8217;s breasts from comics, delicately sewn onto one another emphasizing the well known devotion to them.</p>


	<p>Born in Mexico City and now based in New York City, Amezkua originally trained as a painter, studying in Florence, Italy and receiving her BA from California State University in Fresno. She has shown in numerous galleries, museums and biennials in the United States and Mexico including The Bronx Museum of the Arts, El Museo del Barrio, Queens Museum of Art, Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts, and Movimiento de Arte y Cultura Latino Americana (MACLA). She runs the project space Bronx Blue Bedroom.</p>


	<p>Eunah Kim is a  graduate from Rhode Island School of Design and was awarded with the emerging artist grant from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Her inventive work has been shown across the United States and Europe. She lives and works in Cambridge.</p>
