  <p>Join us for a special selection of artwork by 12 international artists working in a variety of materials and subject matter.  The exhibition will highlight work from past favorites and introduce new talent from abroad.  On view will be work by Lin Shih Pao, Chee Wang Ng, Zhang Hongtu, YoYo Xiao, Kotaro Fukui, Marlene Tseng Yu, Wei Kang, Felix Beyreuther, Dong Ming Guang, Gang Chen, Yu Jie and Gao Yuan.  Crossing Art is pleased to announce the opening of Crossing Art Presents.</p>


	<p>Lin Shih Pao&#8217;s work reflects the most profound concepts of Asian philosophy, namely a deep sympathy for human beings and an appreciation of the value of the union of humans and nature. His paintings often juxtapose traditional Asian brush ink landscapes with contemporary mixed-media constructions, resulting in &#8220;post-surreal&#8221; landscapes.  Lin Shih Pao was born in Taiwan and lives and works in New York, NY.</p>


	<p>Chee Wang Ng explores the identity of the Chinese Diaspora in global society by reevaluating, challenging, and modernizing traditional Chinese allegory that draws upon ancient literature, metaphor, and mythology in various media. His signature theme of a bowl of rice with chopsticks, Eaten your fill of rice?, * is uniquely situated within the photographs and video on display for this exhibition.  Chee Wang Ng was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and lives and works in New York, NY.</p>


	<p>Zhang Hongtu is a smiling insubordinate who toys within the structures of conceptual art by incorporating Chinese iconography and ideology into classic Western (European) paintings. He plays with the fringes of Chinese culture, primarily removing western icons from their art historical settings and replacing them with eastern icons. In The Last Banquet each of the disciples are replaced by a picture of Mao. Growing up during the Chinese Revolution, Zhang is able to weave contrasting ideologies through subversive imagery, appropriation and humor with a tainted flair.  Zhang Hongtu was born in Gangsu, China and lives and works in New York, NY.</p>


	<p>YoYo Xiao uses digital technology to construct a three-dimensional image by successive mutations in order to examine emotional reactions to illusion. He initiates a continuous sequence of unstable calculations that trigger spontaneous distortions and modifications of the image.* Working with computer programs that only a handful of people in the world have the knowledge to use, Xiao reasserts the importance and function of the digital print in contemporary art. YoYo Xiao was born in Shao Shan, China and lives and works in New York, NY.</p>


	<p>Kotaro Fukui&#8217;s work mainly focuses on two motifs: ostriches and iris flowers. His work addresses themes of nature, body, and eastern spirituality.  The eloquent Flightless series investigates movement through line while portraying ostriches.  The rotund shape and rich black coloring of the ostrich&#8217;s body in juxtaposition with the linear shape of the bird&#8217;s extended neck sets the stage for the magnetism of opposites.</p>


	<p>The Silent Flowers series parades luscious blue Iris motifs across brilliant, majestic gold backgrounds. His work is notably steeped in the tradition of Nihonga and the modern Japanese avant-garde.   The material he uses is the tough plant fiber &#8220;washi&#8221;, a traditional Japanese paper. The materials used in traditional Japanese paintings are natural mineral pigments and Indian ink. Kotaro&#8217;s vision and talent unfolds through a range of materials, lyrical expressions, and historical influences of traditional Japanese art.  Kotaro Fukui was born in Japan and lives and works in Tokyo, Japan.</p>


	<p>Marlene Tseng Yu&#8217;s paintings fuse traditional Chinese painting techniques with tempestuous fields of color resulting in harmonious abstractions. Influenced by the temperaments and moods of the natural world Tseng Yu&#8217;s visions manifest themselves on larger than life canvases enveloping the viewer and overwhelming the soul.  Marlene Tseng Yu was born in Taiwan and lives and works in New York, NY.</p>


	<p>Wei Kang, based in Shanghai and trained in classical oil painting, is notorious for his innovations on the paintbrush and the invention of the rubber pen that are now produced in six sizes.  The rubber pen has provided Wei a tool to leave a unique mark, not only in his paintings but, on generations of artists and the world. Wei Kang was born in China and lives and works in Shanghai, China.</p>


	<p>Felix Beyreuther, has been working with photographic media since more than 20 years. Starting of with manipulating Black &#38; White prints, short movies, which International News Agencies have chosen to link to their articles, he now started with animations and animated installations.  In his very latest Artwork he combines cautious visual effects with very subtle sound effects. Especially by the integration of sound the impact of his Artwork spreads over the physical barriers of a common picture frame, and manipulates the surrounding in a positive way. The artwork on display runs for 30mins and has a slightly ironic touch.</p>


	<p>Felix Beyreuther was born in Germany and lived and worked in Beijing, Tokyo, Singapore and currently he is stationed in Shanghai, China.</p>


	<p>Dong Ming Guang uses multiple images of youth to trigger dissident evocations with his fiberglass sculptures. His work reflects a loss of innocence under the duress of society&#8217;s structure. The sitting girls or babies are all bottomless figures; they all wear a nice suit above the waist, but all show directly or indirectly their nude body. The dress symbolizes societal pressure on children. The nude parts recall the original nature of children and the red flowers are spiritual substance. The babies lie on multiple layers of flower pedals, a gesture indirectly pointing both to exoticism and innocent temptation. In most of Dong&#8217;s works, the figure shows little emotion, but sometimes these babies exhibit a bitter face despite representing pure or innocent life.  Dong Ming Guang was born in Shandong Qingdao, China and lives and works in Shandong Qingdao, China.</p>


	<p>Gang Chen through dislocation of objects and scenes, illusions and strange experiences hopes to spiritualize the ritual of Wall Street and rethink human civilization and its more basic animal instincts. He wants to raise the awareness of cheapness versus the relationship between mankind and richness,  in Wall Street which represents the economic center of the world.  He would potentially likes to demonstrate the side of mankind which is unable to express a combination of feelings such as distress mixed with ecstasy; aesthetic beauty with dysfunction.  Gang Chen was born in China and lives and works in New York, NY and Beijing, China.</p>


	<p>Yu Jie&#8217;s 80s&#8217; Girls Series are photographs based on young Chinese women surrounded by telecommunications, internet, online games, and <span class="caps">KTV</span> entertainment.  These women are the most actively censored for changes in modern life.  The healthy youthful bodies on display are associated with complicated, confused yet vivid energy.   Despite the subject&#8217;s cumbersome and complicated lifestyle, Jie uses a simple but straight visual method to represent the women&#8217;s real essence.  The slight exposure of nudity evokes a life attitude of the new generation girl. Yu Jie was born in China and lives and works in Beijing, China.</p>


	<p>Gao Yuan&#8217;s series 12 moons, is composed of 12 photographs of 12 mothers holding their children in different positions. Each photograph has a full moon in the background, suggesting a warm feminine atmosphere. At the same time, the full moon hints at a halo-like religious transcendence. The images referencing Renaissance paintings reveal a sublime beauty and other worldliness of mothers and children motifs across time and space. Gao likes to depict human body tattoo, in these photographs. Each of the 12 children has a body tattoo of different Zodiac animals from Chinese astrology. The artist chose 12 mothers living in Beijing; each woman is the wife of a construction worker, and they are originally from 12 different provinces of China. The background of each photograph is a composite urban view of cities, revealing a fusion of the new and the old landscape. It takes the place of the Renaissance nature landscape, and projects an even surreal and more Chinese aura over these photographs.  Gao Yuan was born in Taipei and lives and works in New York, NY and Beijing, China.</p>
