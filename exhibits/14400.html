  <p>The New York-based arts group, 4heads, is pleased to announce the Fourth Annual Governors Island Art Fair, which will be free and open to the public September 2 – 25, 2011 on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 11am to 6pm.</p>


	<p>Where most looked across the New York Harbor and saw pre-Civil War arsenal buildings and 19th century forts, 4heads saw an opportunity to flood a historic time capsule with contemporary art.  Dreamed up by artists for artists, the Governors Island Art Fair is quickly becoming a hub for constructive exchange between emerging talents, industry professionals, and the public.  Art collectors, curators, 
artists, and other art lovers flock to the island by the thousands for this diverse exposition of new works.</p>


	<p>&#8220;Participation in the fair is free to artists in order to level the playing field,”  says 4heads member Antony Zito.  “We see who&#8217;s really out there and then sift through for the hidden gems of our culture.&#8221;</p>


	<p>For the fourth year, the 4heads panel will choose more than 100 independent artists of merit from around the world to participate in this emerging tradition.  Each artist is granted a room in the abandoned military barracks on Governors Island and is given free reign to design his or her own exhibition space.  The exhibitor roster also includes a select group of innovative galleries.  The result is the dramatic transformation of a national landmark into a spiraling trove of fresh, exciting artwork.</p>


	<p>The epic scope of this fair includes sculpture, photography, painting, video, sound, and object installations. Past highlights range from Joseph Morris’ delicate bone sculptures hanging in the barracks attic, to Sally Dennison’s photographs of imaginary characters created through digital manipulation of her own self-portraits.  The list of participants for 2011 will be announced at the end of July.</p>


	<p>With interactive creative programs, performance art and musical acts mixed in throughout the run of the fair, visitors can expect the unexpected around every corner.  This summer, 4heads will also offer workshops and artists’ studio residencies leading up to the fair. Check <a href="http://www.4heads.org">www.4heads.org</a> for updates about live music, special events, and workshop programs.</p>


	<p>4heads is an arts group sponsored by New York Foundation for the Arts and led by founding members Nicole Laemmle, Jack Robinson, Ernie Sandidge, and Antony Zito—all working artists themselves.  With an emphasis on beautifying unused spaces, the group is committed to providing diverse venues and forums to present, advocate and serve artists everywhere.</p>


	<p>The Governors Island Art Fair was originated by 4heads in 2008. Admission to the fair is free. Hours are 11am – 6pm on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, September 2 – 25, 2011. Refreshments will be available at the fair: fresh Two-Boots pizza and an array of Porchetta sandwiches.  Governors Island is accessible by a free 7-minute ferry ride from the Battery Maritime Building (10 South Street) in Lower Manhattan or a 3-minute ferry ride from Brooklyn Bridge Park’s Pier 6 (at the end of Atlantic Avenue, at Columbia Street) in Brooklyn. On Fridays, there is no free ferry service from Brooklyn, but there is a paid East River ferry. For directions and further information or call 212.673.9074.</p>
