  <p>Family Bookstore is happy to announce our contribution to Thirty Days NY! From April 8 &#8211; May 7, we&#8217;ll have a 4200 sq foot Tribeca storefront to host a Family Bookstore, an &#8216;artists in conversation&#8217; series, bands, performances, author readings, an art exhibition, and artists in residency. Thirty Days NY is the next wave of Absolut Vodka&#8217;s creative collaborations and expands its commitment to the artistic space. <span class="caps">A TBWA</span> Production.</p>


	<p>The interior of the space and flier image are designed by Ben Jones of Paper Rad. All events are free and open to the public.</p>


	<p>Week One:</p>


	<p>King Kong: An exhibition of art from Los Angeles (April 8 &#8211; May 7)</p>


	<p>April 8: Opening Party, 7 &#8211; 10pm</p>


	<p>Live sets by: Aska + Brian Degraw (Gang Gang Dance) accompanied by psychedelic light show by Joshua White and Gary Panter</p>


	<p>Geoff Mcfetridge * Brian Roettinger * Ashley Snow Macomber * Sergio Aragones * Pablo Ferro * Kyle Field * Hamburger eyes * Cali Thornhill Dewitt * Deanna Templeton * Ed Templeton * Rodarte * Autumn De Wilde</p>


	<p>King Kong exhibits a diverse array of art making in Los Angeles, including many artists who generally work outside of galleries, presenting a certain visionary, weirdo Los Angeles spirit. King Kong includes new paintings by Geoff Mcfetridge, a designer who most recently created the titles for Spike Jonze&#8217;s Where the Wild Things Are, as well as Brian Roettinger who was nominated for a Grammy for his album design on No Age&#8217;s &#8216;Nouns&#8217;. The show includes gag drawings that appeared in the margins of Mad Magazine by Sergio Aragones, and diary photography capturing the abandoned junk lining Los Angeles streets by Cali Thornhill Dewitt, from his Teenage Teardrops blog.</p>


	<p>King Kong also has an emphasis on the creative process, showcasing works that developed as a means to an end, yet turn up as compelling artworks in themselves. Such pieces include fabric experiments by fashion designers, Rodarte, as well as film title mockup sketches and presentation boards from the 60s by Pablo Ferro. Ferro revolutionized film title design in the 60s with his titles for Dr Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, and Harold and Maude.</p>


	<p>The physical landscape of Los Angeles itself turns up in black and white photos by the photography collective Hamburger Eyes, and Deanna Templeton&#8217;s documentary photos of the phenomenon of beach-goers being stenciled with surf-wear logos.</p>


	<p>The artists represent the aesthetic and community around Family Bookstore itself.</p>


	<p>Week One&#8217;s Artists In Residency:</p>


	<p>Meryl Smith: April 8 &#8211; May 7. Smith will be working on a large scale sculpture throughout the month. Smith created the props for the Spike Jonze&#8217;s recent short film, I&#8217;m Here, as well as a related window installation for Opening Ceremony NY entitled Modern Love</p>


	<p>Joshua White and Gary Panter: April 8 &#8211; May 7. White and Panter will be accompanying musical guests throughout the month with psychedelic light shows. White is credited with inventing the psychedelic light show in the 60s at San Francisco&#8217;s Fillmore East for artists like Jimi Hendrix and The Grateful Dead. Panter designed the sets for Pee Wee&#8217;s Playhouse in the 60s and designed iconic fliers for 80s punk bands The Germs and Screamers</p>


	<p>Aska Matsumiya: April 8 &#8211; April 17. From 12 &#8211; 3pm, Matsumiya will spend the opening week improvising with suprise musical guests, and recording. Various sound-making tools will be set up for visitors. Matsumiya plays in The Sads and is a founder of the Los Angeles Ladies&#8217; Choir</p>


	<p>Week One&#8217;s Special Events:</p>


	<p>April 10 &#8211; Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore perform live as Mirror/Dash. Followed by a signing of the brand new Sonic Youth art book <span class="caps">SENSATIONAL FIX</span>, and the limited edition <span class="caps">KIM GORDON</span>: THE <span class="caps">NOISE PAINTINGS</span></p>


	<p>April 11 &#8211; Comedy by Fred Armison + Andrew Jeffrey Wright. Armison is a comedian, actor, and musician, best known for his work on Saturday Night Live. Wright is an artist, zine-maker, animator, and comedian</p>


	<p>April 12 &#8211; Aaron Rose presents rare and unseen short films and <span class="caps">VHS</span> tapes. Rose was the owner and director of NY&#8217;s Alleged Gallery, creator of Alleged Press, co-editor of <span class="caps">ANP</span> Quarterly, and director of the documentary Beautiful Losers</p>


	<p>April 13 &#8211; Author Readings by A.M. Homes, Sean Wilsey, and Hugh Nissenson. Followed by conversation moderated by Ross Simonini of the Believer magazine</p>


	<p>Note: Family Bookstore is only one element of this wide reaching project. Beyond the space Family is curating, Dallas Clayton has been gathering material by some great videographers interviewing artists around the US at thirtydaysny.com. That will run for longer than our contribution to the project, so keep checking it after our space wraps up. When we&#8217;re up and running you&#8217;ll be able to watch videos of Family&#8217;s events there, and see recent event updates and event additions!</p>
