<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Causey Contemporary is pleased to present two solo exhibitions this April, <em>New Paintings</em> by Marc Brotherton and <em>Acid Bath</em> by Nina Carelli. Marking his third solo exhibition with the gallery, Brotherton will present his newest series of bold, mixed-media paintings, which explore ideas of new technology, communication, color and design. <em>Acid Bath</em> will feature Nina Carelli’s eclectic and often eccentric etchings and hand-made books. This will be her first solo exhibition. Both shows will be on view from April 20th to May 27th, 2012 at the gallery’s Williamsburg, Brooklyn location. A public reception will be held with both artists on April 20th, 6–9 pm.</p>


	<p>Marc Brotherton contends that living in the twenty-first century, we are constantly bombarded by input– be it from televisions, news sources, the internet, or one of the many communication gadgets. In a way, Brotherton’s paintings are a form of communication, which address technological and political quandaries, but also banalities of daily life. The outcome of his work is a materialized investigation into the perplexing world in which we live. Brotherton states that his incentive to make art  comes from an “...inner curiosity, a personal necessity to acknowledge an awareness that we are here together inhabiting an increasingly chaotic world.”</p>


	<p>Brotherton is an Atlanta-based aritist, who received his <span class="caps">BFA</span> from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and his <span class="caps">MFA</span> degree from Brooklyn College, NY. He has held five solo exhibitions in New York City, and two in Georgia. His work has been featured in many group exhibitions across the country, more notably with the George Billis Gallery in <span class="caps">NYC</span>, Kiang Gallery, The Dalton Gallery, and at The Museum of Contemporary Art, all in Atlanta, GA. Additionally, He is currently one of the Artists in Residence at the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center. Marc’s work has been mentioned in the pages of The New York Times, NY Arts Magazine, Flash Art and The Albuquerque Journal. He has recently begun teaching as  an art professor at Kennesaw State University.</p>


	<p>Also on view will be Nina Carelli’s etchings. The title <em>Acid Bath</em> references the antiquarian etching process:  zinc plate drawings are surrendered into a bath of nitric acid; it is there where a mysterious, unique, transformation occurs, where all aspects of predictability and limitation dissolve. “Fascination and awe towards natural and artificial realms motivate my work. The imagery oscillates between amorphous compartments of interest that simultaneously overlap and contradict one another. I prefer not to narrate or specify the existence of things. I’m more interested in the interactions that unfold between eclectic depictions.”</p>


	<p>Nina Carelli received her <span class="caps">BFA</span> from the School of Visual Arts in New York City and is currently living and working in Brooklyn, NY. She has participated in group exhibitions at the Brooklyn Artists’ Gym, Culturefix Gallery, Greenpoint Gallery, Coo Gallery, Sacred Gallery and Causey Contemporary, all in New York, as well as at the Featherstone Center for the Arts in Martha’s Vineyard and The Monmouth Museum in New Jersey. Ms. Carelli is the editor of the self-published art magazine and collective, <span class="caps">CREEPS</span>, which has been printed annually in 2010 and 2011 as an editioned publication. Her work has been mentioned and reviewed in the Visual Arts Magazine and Vice Magazine. In 2010 she was awarded the Shakespeare and Co. Bookmaking Grant and in 2011 the Silver Cube from the Art Director’s Club.</p>


	<p>Both <em>New Paintings</em> and <em>Acid Bath</em> will open on April 20th, 6–9 pm, and will be on view through May 27th, 2012. The public is invited to attend the reception and visit these exhibitions during normal gallery hours: Wednesday–Saturday, 11–7 p.m. And Sunday noon–6 p.m. For additional information, contact the gallery, 718-218-8939 or via email, <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="99f0f7fff6d9faf8eceafce0faf6f7edfcf4e9f6ebf8ebe0b7faf6f4">[email&#160;protected]</a></p>
