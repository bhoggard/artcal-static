<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Monya Rowe Gallery is pleased to announce a group exhibition featuring Timothy Bergstrom, Sarah Dornner, Joe Pflieger and Mark Schubert.</p>


	<p>The four artists in this exhibition are united by their conceptual and material investigation. The amassment of visual disparity aims to demonstrate a unique juxtaposition and reading between the works, which includes sculpture, photography and painting. Each artist presents a formal approach to the subject, but then reshapes expectations of space, texture and perception.</p>


	<p>Timothy Bergstrom (b. 1984) presents a series of paintings comprised from paint and objects, such as string, floss and mirrors. Tension is created through his synthesis of various media. This intentional mix of low-brow elements with traditional painting complicates the work and disrupts any easy interpretation, forcing the work to act as painting and sculpture. Bergstrom graduated with a <span class="caps">BFA</span> from School of Visual Arts, New York, NY and a <span class="caps">MFA</span> from School of the Art Institute of Chicago in Illinois. His work has recently been included in a group show at Western Exhibitions, Chicago, IL and was the subject of a solo exhibition at Hungryman Gallery, also in Chicago. Bergstrom lives and works in Chicago, Illinois.</p>


	<p>Sarah Dornner’s (b. 1979) elegant and calculated floor sculpture conveys the artists’ interest in architectural space and mathematics combined with the use of everyday materials. At first glance, Double Trap (2010), comprised of blue ribbon and white wood, is seemingly functional; in this way, the work investigates individual perceptions of space. The graphic angles, voids and geometric composition distort the viewer’s perception of what feels like infinite space by threatening to collapse the area within it. Dornner graduated with a BA from the University of California, Los Angeles and a <span class="caps">MFA</span> from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Her work has been exhibited at Albright-Knox Gallery, Buffalo, NY; Galerie <span class="caps">IFF</span>, Marseille, France; Casey Kaplan Gallery, New York, NY; and in a group exhibition at Monya Rowe Gallery curated by Patrick Brennan. Dornner lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.</p>


	<p>Joe Pflieger (b. 1977) blurs the lines between photography, painting and sculpture. Continuing his interest with surface texture, usually absent in photography, Pflieger’s new works explore space, duality and light. These reoccurring themes are used to disorient the pictorial space, while adding depth and conceptual curiosity. Pflieger received a <span class="caps">MFA</span> in Art Theory and Practice from Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois and a <span class="caps">BFA</span> in Painting and Printmaking from University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin. His photographs have recently been exhibited at The Green Gallery (curated by Jose Lerma), Milwaukee, WI; Andrew Rafacz Gallery, Chicago, IL; and Monya Rowe Gallery. Pflieger’s work is included in a site-specific year long group exhibition at The Poor Farm in Central Wisconsin this summer (organized by Michelle Grabner and Brad Killam), and he will have his second solo exhibition at Monya Rowe Gallery in 2012. He will also curate the summer exhibition at Monya Rowe Gallery this June. Pflieger lives and works in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>


	<p>Mark Schubert’s (b. 1977) sculptures, made from found materials and then painted with enamel, are heavily driven by psychological explorations. In reshaping an object that already exists Schubert redefines its’ meaning by adding a charged and nostalgic dialogue, while possessing a deliberate kinship to painting. Schubert received a <span class="caps">BFA</span> from University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin and completed graduate coursework in Painting at University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. His work has recently been exhibited at South First Gallery, Brooklyn, NY; The Green Gallery, Milwaukee, WI; Thierry Goldberg Projects, New York, NY and in a group exhibition at Monya Rowe Gallery curated by Patrick Brennan. Schubert lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
