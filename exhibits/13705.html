  <p>Opening Reception with the Artists: Saturday, May 7, 7–10 pm
Curatorial Talk: Wednesday, May 11, 6:30 pm</p>


	<p>Concrete Utopia, with the support of the Art in Empty Spaces initiative sponsored by Community Board 3 and No Longer Empty, is pleased to announce i am not a good enough feminist, a group exhibition and accompanying publication.  In an era of presumed gender equality and celebrated civil rights achievements, have we become complacent and disinterested in the discourse of feminism today? This project seeks to investigate feminism as a historically situated moment and the possibilities and necessities of its contemporary manifestations. As a show, i am not a good enough feminist is the interdisciplinary convergence of artists, writers, activists and intellectuals contemplating their experiences with, preconceptions of, and convictions surrounding feminism. Join us.</p>


	<p>The exhibition and publication integrate well-established voices in art and scholarship with emerging young artists in what promises to be an egalitarian, earnest, collective effort to question, confront, and inspire.  The book of interviews, original texts, and reprinted materials includes notable contributors Carolee Schneemann, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Yvonne Rainer.  As a group show, i am not a good enough feminist exhibits the work of 23 artists whose practice engages notions of gender, sexual identity, privilege, socio-economic power, among other themes.  Pieces in the exhibition vary in medium such as the video “Sisters: A Hit for a Museum” by Fabienne Audéoud (debuted at Centre Pompidou in 2009), painting by Joan Snitzer of A.I.R. Gallery, ergonomic sculpture by Johana Moscoso, and installation by Lizzy De Vita.</p>


	<p>i am not a good enough feminist was made possible, in part, with generous support from No Longer Empty, Community Board 3, and the Barall Family Trust—owners 58 Lispenard Street.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">CONCRETE UTOPIA</span> is a project space devoted to the innovative cultivation of creative practice and discourse. The space, which opened in Williamsburg in the fall of 2010, hosts group shows, solo shows, site-specific installations, collaborations, film and video screenings, performances, readings, off-site interventions, and anything we dream up. We, in our space, believe that we are what is to come&#8212;utopia in its perpetual state of being actualized, in its most palpable and material possibility.  With this is mind, <span class="caps">CONCRETE UTOPIA</span> is also an open space of immodest humor, of mistakes, and of dubious uncertainty. We are a project space, a work in progress, a constant reinvention. <span class="caps">CONCRETE UTOPIA</span> is collectively-structured, and its participants volunteer in various capacities, bringing diverse skills, interests, and educational backgrounds.  Visit <span class="caps">CONCRETE UTOPIA</span>’s booth at the Affordable Art Fair, May 5-9 2011.
i am not a good enough feminist is co-curated by Melanie Kress and Kate Ryan.</p>


	<p>No Longer Empty transforms vacated storefronts to site specific art exhibitions a way to widen the audience for art and to revitalize areas around the venues by bringing thoughtful, high-caliber art installations with accompanying programs to the public.  Committed to art as a catalyst, No Longer Empty conducts outreach into the community to contribute meaningfully and bolster the local businesses through the increased flow of visitors that these exhibitions attract and by arranging programs such as panel discussions, music and performance evenings, children&#8217;s workshops, artist conversations and 
more.</p>


	<p>Community Board 3, Manhattan covers the Lower East Side and part of Chinatown. The boundaries of the district are 14th Street on the north, the East River on the east and the south, and Fourth Avenue and the Bowery on the west, extending to Baxter and Pearl Streets and the Brooklyn Bridge south of Canal Street. It is a community filled with a diversity of cultures, religions, incomes, and languages. Its character, drawn from its heritage as a historic first stop for many immigrants, continues to the present day. Community Board 3 has an important advisory role in dealing with land use and zoning matters, the City budget, municipal service delivery and many other matters relating to their communities&#8217; welfare.</p>
