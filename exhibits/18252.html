<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Agape Enterprise is pleased to begin our fall season with “Frame,” a project by Chelsea Knight. “Frame” is a single channel video that explores the “construction of gender” through a delegated performance by construction workers, reciting feminist theoretical texts and poetry. Set in a room painted black, a team of male and female construction workers of various races and ages assemble metal frames while reciting texts from feminist theoretical writing and poems. A large part of feminist texts aim to analyze the voice of patriarchy. Thus, a series of recitations of feminist texts, woven together with performers’ personal stories, unfolds to reflect a long-standing ideological gender conflict.</p>


	<p>Gender, as the social organization of hierarchical relationships coded as feminine/masculine, does not merely refer to the difference of sexes, but also to a variety of other differences, including class and race. Knight’s “Frame,” through presenting a group of a particular class, yet also imbued with the differences of sex, race, age and sexual orientation, questions who is actually the “feminine.” The piece also offers deep insight into dynamics of power/resistance in mutual formation. In the end, “Frame” leaves us to wonder what this construction is becoming: the structure of power/resistance that is constantly in the process of construction? Or more positively, how does each of us envision ourselves to take part in its making?</p>


	<pre><code>“Frame” will be accompanied with three performances by Jonathan Van Dyke, Yamil Rodriguez and Elise Rasmussen, in the following weeks. In order to further explore the relationship of the “performance of the self” and language, as proposed in “Frame,” Knight has asked these artists to create performances that disrupt the normative relationship between the self and language.</code></pre>


	<p>Friday, September 28th, 6-9pm: 
Jonathan VanDyke, With One Hand Between Us (+ 1)</p>


	<p>With One Hand Between Us (+ 1) is a one-night reprisal of a 40-hour work that VanDyke created last fall for Performa 11, here stripped of the props, costumes, makeup, sculptures, and dripping paint that marked the original. Two men and one woman move without speaking, constantly re-defining their relationships, shifting from tenderness to aggression, from familiarity to perversion, from military-like discipline to rampant chaos; VanDyke performs as the “+1,” moving in and out of the action and offering such loaded cues as, &#8220;shift into prayer sequence,&#8221; and &#8220;prostitute yourself.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Friday, October 5th, 7-8:30pm: 
Yamil Rodriguez, Dirty Story, Live Performance, 2012</p>


	<p>Rodriguez has been interested in the multifarious language used in erotic literature and the effectiveness of certain vernacular on the reader. Dirty Story explores the theme of breaking character in language using subtleties in diction, emphasis and vocabulary.</p>


	<p>Friday, October 12th, 7-8:30pm: 
Elise Rasmussen, Untitled, Live Performance, 2012</p>


	<p>Rasmussen’s Untitled looks at aspects of memory and recollection, weaving together narratives from various sources, including those provided by the audience, to show how perception of personal and known histories are affected.</p>
