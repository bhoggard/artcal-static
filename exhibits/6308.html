  <p>At a public reception at Eyebeam Saturday, December 15, Executive Director Amanda McDonald Crowley announced the winners of Eyebeam&#8217;s two-part, online Eco-Vis Challenge competition. Oz Etzioni&#8217;s Unrecyclable Icon was awarded a $2000 grand prize in the Eco-Icons category, and the Studio for Urban Projects&#8217; In Popular Terms, the Evolving Language of Ecology was awarded a $2000 grand prize in the Eco-Visualization category. The winning projects will be previewed during the month of January, and exhibited as part of Eyebeam&#8217;s Feedback show in March 2008.</p>


	<p>Two proposals in each category received Honorable Mentions and prize money of $150 each, also earmarked for realization of the projects in conjunction with the Feedback exhibition. For Eco-Icons, Green Map was recognized for &#8220;creating a comprehensive and inspiring visual system and vocabulary,&#8221; and Forays&#8217; project Edible Excess for &#8220;the practical application and smart design of an Eco-Icon.&#8221; In the Eco-Visualization category, Annina RÃ¼st&#8217;se-RiceCooker was named &#8220;a wonderful and novel concept for social conviviality and structured participation,&#8221; and Timm Kekeritz&#8217;s Virtual Water and Water Footprints project was recognized for its &#8220;clarity, visual literacy and fluency of design.&#8221;</p>


	<p>The Eco-Vis Challenge solicited proposals on increasing environmental awareness through creative data interpretation over the course of a four-month period in Fall 2007, and the winners were chosen from a field of 139 proposals.</p>


	<p>The competition was juried by engineer and techno-artist Natalie Jeremijenko, mathematician Martin Wattenberg, a researcher at <span class="caps">IBM</span> whose work focuses on visual explorations of culturally significant data, Joey Roth, an industrial designer and writer for TreeHugger.com, Casey Caplowe, creative director of <span class="caps">GOOD</span> Magazine, Elizabeth Thompson, executive director of the Buckminster Fuller Institute, Eyebeam Alums Michael Mandiberg, and Brooke Singer, with Eyebeam&#8217;s Amanda McDonald Crowley and Paul Amitai moderating.</p>


	<p>The winning and honored proposals will be on display at Eyebeam in January as a preview for the March 13 &#8211; April 19 Feedback exhibition, which will feature the realized proposals alongside work by past and current Eyebeam artists, with others. Both events are part of Eyebeam&#8217;s ongoing Beyond Light Bulbs programming series, which grew from the conversations and findings of Eyebeam&#8217;s Sustainability Research Group.</p>


	<p>The Eco-Vis challenge was crafted by Research Group members Michael Mandiberg a 2007-08 Fellow in the R&#38;D OpenLab and Brooke Singer, an Eyebeam alum.</p>


	<p>The Eyebeam Sustainability Research Group began in July 2006 as a forum for past and present residents, fellows, and staff to engage in a critical dialogue about environmental sustainability. The group&#8217;s monthly meetings have covered a range of issues, from sharing creative research to working on practical ways to &#8220;green&#8221; the Eyebeam facility. Out of these meetings, a number of public programs and exhibitions have been developed, including the Eco-Vis Design Challenge, the upcoming Eyebeam exhibition Feedback, and the ambitious 2007-8 program series, Beyond Light Bulbs. Among the Sustainability Research Group reBloggers are: Jennifer Broutin, Carmen Trudell, Brooke Singer, Paul Amitai, Leah Gauthier, Michael Mandiberg and Amanda McDonald Crowley, who have all been contributing content to Eyebeam&#8217;s reBlog website. This content, as well as the online eco-vis projects of Ben Engebreth, Brooke Singer and Michael Mandiberg will be on display alongside those of Challenge winners.</p>


	<p>Prizes were generously underwritten by Deep Green Living, green consultants for home and business.</p>
