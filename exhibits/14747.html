  <p>Keyed
Curated by Glen Baldridge
Opening Reception: Wednesday, September 14, 6-8pm</p>


	<p>Exhibition Dates: September 14 – November 9, 2011
Hours: Weekdays from 10am – 6pm, and weekends from 12 &#8211; 6pm
Free and open to the public</p>


	<p>Lower East Side Printshop is pleased to present Keyed, with a reception for artists on Wednesday, September 14 from 6-8pm. The exhibition will be on view at the Printshop from September 14 – November 9, 2011 and features new works on paper created by 17 artists currently in-residence.</p>


	<p>This exhibition represents recent works from current Keyholder Residency Program artists and participants in the Studio Rental Program. These programs provide NY area artists access to both
affordable facilities and a close knit print community; both of which are essential to self publishing printmakers. The exhibited works are a great example of both the range of techniques and experimentation possible at the shop and the high caliber of work being produced there. As a former Keyholder, it is exciting to see the continuation of these programs and the expansion into the beautiful Midtown facilities.   It continues to be a muchneeded contribution to printmaking in New York City and the print community at large. -Glen Baldridge</p>
