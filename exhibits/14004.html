<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Super Nature, a fine art exhibition featuring three female contemporary artists will run June 16—21 at the 4 N Main Gallery in Southampton, New York. Melinda Hackett, Meghan Boody and Kathryn Lynch will exhibit their recent work in a collection curated by Carole Reed, a Southampton-based independent curator and interior designer.</p>


	<p>The three artists are connected through their friendship, their residences in the Hamptons and New York City and most importantly, the nature-based art they create.</p>


	<p>As the purest form of existence, yet the most complex, nature forms the building blocks of life and transforms itself continuously over time, a concept paralleled in the Super Nature exhibition.  With each of the artists approaching the natural world through her unique filter, the resulting collection is colorful and complex, transcendent and kinetic.  It represents the natural world on a cellular and a macro level. Throughout each of the works are physical representations of life, yet each piece is layered with metaphysical mysticism and otherworldly themes.</p>


	<p>Meghan Boody, one of the longest-working artists in digital photography, uses fantastical symbolism to depict inner change and often deploys nature to evoke the wilderness of the human psyche. For many years, the exploration of mythical environments has informed her photographic and sculptural work. Boody casts frames from acrylic for each narrative series that question standard framing practices and entangle the viewer in another level of symbolism and meaning.  She holds a BA from Georgetown University, has studied at Parsons Paris School of Art &#38; Design and apprenticed with noted photographer Hans Namuth.  Her work can be seen in the March 7, 2011 issue of New York Magazine, at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art at Cornell University.</p>


	<p>Kathryn Lynch, who has an <span class="caps">MFA</span> from the University of Pennsylvania, paints what she observes in her daily life.  Lynch creates dramatic, empathetic interpretations of cityscapes and earthly wonders such as water, wind and sky. Her paintings become a mixture of remembering and forgetting, noticing and knowing.  Lynch’s work can be found in the University of California at Berkeley Art Museum along with many corporate and private collections including that of actress and recording artist Jennifer Lopez, as seen in the winter 2006 issue of Vogue Living. Among other honors, Lynch was the featured artist in Elle Décor’s April 2009 issue.</p>


	<p>Melinda Hackett’s lively paintings approach nature on its cellular level through symbolism and indirect reference. Each piece combines a force of amoebic beings that move through space at various rates of speed and in opposite directions, some gliding slowly and others whirring with high energy. Hackett’s paintings explore themes such as shape shifting and space relative to time and distance.  For those with a sharp eye, a peace sign can be found hiding in the layers of each painting. A native New Yorker with an <span class="caps">MFA</span> from Parsons New School, Hackett is a featured artist on Artstar.com and has been profiled in Women’s Wear Daily and the Wall Street Journal.  She recently worked with <span class="caps">UNESCO</span> to create a line of original postcards and is currently in collaboration with a code writer and computer programmer to create a series of moving paintings shown on screens.</p>


	<p>Carole Reed, curator of Super Nature, is a Southampton-based designer and art consultant.  Having studied art at Oxford University, she has been a curator since 1994.  Her artistic roots span the nation as she is a former board member at the Contemporary Art Museum in New Orleans and launched two major American folk art exhibitions in Los Angeles and New York. Reed also served as curator of the House of Blues Outsider Art Collection, the largest public collection of American folk art in the world. Her designs have been published in Traditional Home, Hamptons Cottages &#38; Gardens and The New York Times.</p>


	<p>The Super Nature exhibition will extend beyond the gallery, bringing together a kindred group of women who share a long history of friendship and success in the worlds of fine art, food and fashion. Downtown New York City residents Lynch, Hackett and Boody have been friends for almost 30 years and each have homes on the East End; in Shelter Island, Southampton and Southold, respectively.  The juxtaposition of a fast-paced city life and an unhurried beach town existence comes through in not only their work, but also their professional and personal relationships.</p>


	<p>Friends of the artists include Hamptons-based fashion designer Claudja Bicalho, whose Amagansett retail store LazyPoint houses her flirty, colorful designs. Each of the artists will wear a dress from Bicalho’s latest collection at the June 18th opening reception. Another mutual friend, celebrated restaurateur and author Alison Becker, who is also based in New York City and the East End, will create a signature Super Nature dish for the opening reception.</p>
