<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p><strong>Coleman Burke Gallery</strong> is pleased to present <em><strong>Limits of the Mind</strong></em>, a solo exhibition featuring new works by artist <strong>Ben Butler</strong>.  The exhibition will be on view to the public from March 17th through April 28th.  An opening reception will be held on Friday, March 18th from 6 – 8pm.</p>


	<p>In his sculpture and drawings, Butler employs deceptively simple processes that manifest spectacularly complex forms and images.  Within a strict set of parameters, each piece grows by means of accumulated gestures or marks, resulting in work that alludes to both the systematic nature of human thought and activity and to the overwhelming complexity and diversity of natural forms.  The exhibition title, Limits of the Mind, suggests Butler’s interests in a particular level of complexity, the threshold between comprehension and wonder.  The sprawling floor sculpture Drift presents to the viewer a richly evocative cluster of forms, somewhat geological, vaguely biomorphic and decidedly complex. Closer examination, however, reveals what Butler calls “the story of its making”, the process of shaping wooden boards, modestly and incrementally, and arranging them in sequence.  The ink drawings, from the ongoing Invention series, are built from intricate lines that follow a simple and strict grid pattern.  But the lines weave and undulate in response to each other and together render a surprising variety of forms ranging from torn fabric fragments to vast topographical maps.  Although the work draws from disparate sources and influences, Butler has most recently found a focused interest in its relation to scientific theory, particularly that of Stephen Wolfram, who’s book, A New Kind of Science, demonstrates how the simplest of computer programs can generate immensely complex results and even randomness.  Butler is interested in the implications of this discovery and how, through the use of his “programs”, he can offer a contemplative visual experience on our understanding of both the human mind and natural growth.  The work draws us in and rewards our careful looking.  As the artist describes, “Every thing has a source.  When the order of things eludes us, we often mistake complexity for chaos, and therefore miss the wonderful sources of things.”</p>
