	<p>Curated  by: Inbred Hybrid Collective</p>


	<p>Featured artists: Michele Brody, Walt Cessna, Michelle Handelman, John Kelly, Scooter LaForge, Max Carlos Martinez, Rob Roth,  Smith &#38; Lowles, Reynolds Tenazas, and Lili White</p>


	<p><span class="caps">ABOUT THE EVENT</span>:</p>


	<p>The London Biennale was founded in 1998 by David Medalla. It has evolved into an artist community loosely based around London and the biennial events that take place there. Totaling over 300 artists around the world, the Biennale organization is not restricted to London, playing an active part in international events. Linking Satellite Events to the London Biennale was conceived by Adam Nankervis, the founder and director of <span class="caps">MUSEUM MAN</span>.  During London Biennale 2010 Satellite Events have taken place or will take place in Rome on the Pincio Garden, organised by Raffaella Losapio of GalleryStudioRA; in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, organised by Adam Nankervis; in the Social Hall of the Philippine Embassy at Washington, D.C., organised by Marvin de la Cruz Santos; in Las Vegas, organised by Jevijoe Vitug; in Madrid, organised by Filippos Tsitsopoulos; in Prague, organised by Arjan Kok and Julia Drouhin; in San Francisco, organised by Chelsea Wilks and John Dugger; and in Boston, organised by Mary Sherman and Trans-Cultural Exchange (plus many more)</p>


	<p>For more info, please log into the London Biennale Page in Facebook.</p>


	<p>The London Biennale <span class="caps">NYC</span> Satellite Event is conceived and curated by Inbred Hybrid Collective in conversation with David Medalla as a way to bring the themes and experiences of the London Biennale into a more primary context for New York&#8217;s artistic community, hi-lighting the strengths of individual artists while promoting the virtues of art without borders.  While this event is not medium-specific, the diversity of the work demonstrates the needs of artists to excel beyond expectation in manifesting positive changes in the world with which they have been presented.  We are very grateful for the opportunity to work with an internationally cohesive enterprise such as the London Biennale and wish to thank all of the artists involved in this show whose work represents the best of the trans-Atlantic artistic community in <span class="caps">NYC</span>.  This exhibition would not be possible without the generous support of Christopher Henry Gallery.</p>


	<p><span class="caps">ARTIST BIOGRAPHIES</span>:</p>


	<p>Michele Brody:</p>


	<p>Born in Brooklyn, NY in 1967, Michele Brody received her BA from Sarah Lawrence College in 1989 and an <span class="caps">MFA</span> from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1994. Utilizing her strong background in the liberal arts, she creates site-specific, mixed media installations and works of public art that are generated by the history, culture, environment, and architecture of a wide range of exhibition spaces. While living and working in such places as France, Costa Rica, California, the Midwest, Germany, and her home of New York, her art career has developed into a process of working in collaboration with each new community as a means towards developing an interpretation of the sense of a place as an outsider looking in.</p>


	<p>Michele Brody has had one-person shows at the Temple Judea Museum in Elkins Park, PA, Chashama, in <span class="caps">NYC</span>, Littlejohn Contemporary in <span class="caps">NYC</span>, Dina4 Projekte in Munich, Germany, the Museo de Arte y Diseño Contemporaneo in San Jose, Costa Rica, and at Le Quai de la Batterie, Atelier-galerie d&#8217;Art Contemporain in Arras, France.</p>


	<p>She has been the recipient of grants from the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, Pollock/ Krasner Foundation, New York Foundation for the Arts, and New York State Council on the Arts&#8217; Architecture, Planning &#38; Design Program; and, residencies at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation, the Headlands Center for the Arts, and at Marywood University.</p>


	<p>In the spring of 2006 she completed two major permanent public art installations in The Bronx. They consist of a series of faceted glass windscreens for an elevated train platform with the <span class="caps">MTA</span> Arts for Transit program, and a hand painted tile mural for a new school through the Public Art for Public Schools program. She has also installed a uniquely designed manhole cover in the sidewalk of Wall Street in commemoration of the Assay Office that once stood at 30 Wall Street.</p>

	<p>Michelle Handelman:</p>


	<p>Michelle Handelman makes confrontational works that explore the sublime in its various forms of excess and nothingness. Starting out as a photographer with a series of haunting self-portraits, she has developed a body of work that incorporates video, performance photography, and various forms of digital media.  Her videos haves screened internationally including Georges Pompidou Centre, Paris; <span class="caps">ICA</span>, London; American Film Institute; Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley and her performances have been featured at Performa 05, the first biennial of visual performance, <span class="caps">NYC</span>; Exit Art, <span class="caps">NYC</span>; 3LD Art &#38; Technology Center, <span class="caps">NYC</span>; Participant, Inc., <span class="caps">NYC</span> and The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art.

	<p>In the mid 90s Handelman directed the feature documentary BloodSisters, an in-depth look at the San Francisco Leatherdyke scene that has just been re-released by the Tribeca Film Institute. Before moving to New York in 1999 Handelman collaborated for many years with Monte Cazazza, a pioneer of the Industrial music scene in San Francisco. Their explicit film Catscan broke into the art world through a series of guerrilla actions where Handelman and Cazazza commandeered the projector during many of the city’s anti-censorship rallies. Together they built several bodies of work including The Torture Series, the video short Hope (1995 Sony Visions Award); the co-authored The Cereal Box Conspiracy Against the Developing Mind published in Apocalypse Culture 2, Feral House Press. Her fiction and critical writing appears in Inappropriate Behaviour (Serpents Tail, London 2001); Coming Up: the World’s Best Erotic Writing edited by Michael Perkins (Kasak Books, <span class="caps">NY 1995</span>), and Herotica 3 edited by Susie Bright (Plume Books, <span class="caps">SF 1994</span>) well as several periodicals.

	<p>Reynolds Tenazas</p>


	<p>Reynolds first studied art in St. James Episcopal School, and developed a lifelong fascination with religious art and demonology.  The Church was a center of anti-war activism, which inspired her attachment to issues of social justice.  She studied painting with Richard Pousette-Dart and printmaking with Ansei Uchima at Sarah Lawrence College, graduating with a concentration in Women’s History.  She also holds a B.F.A., and an M.F.A. from School of Visual Arts. While at <span class="caps">SVA</span>, she furthered her printmaking with Chaim Koppelman, and did most of her prints at Chaim’s Broome Street Studio for the next twenty years. She also printed at Robert Blackburn’s studio. Upon Broome Street’s closure, she pulled the print “Abomination” at Manhattan Graphics.  All of the etchings in the present show were printed at Lower East Side Printshop.</p>


	<p>Reynolds is also a painter who performs “The Puki Procession”, a participatory performance, which can be seen on the site  “Cornwall Tube” under reynoldsnart. She is also included in “Paper Politics”, a travelling print show organized by Josh MacPhee. Her print “Desecration” is featured in his book: Paper Politics:  Socially Engaged Printmaking Today. She has participated in every London Biennale event since its inception in 2000, and in the first “Pollination” of 2003; “Changing Channels” organized by Adam Nankervis and Bill Allen. The most recent show featuring her prints was in Valparaiso, Chile:  “Moving Mediators: Ghosts of Interventions Past and Present” with Museum <span class="caps">MAN</span>.  She continues her anti-war activism with the Quakers, and is active with issues of reproductive justice.</p>


	<p>Reynolds’ etchings present specters from other times that mediate in contemporary political and personal contexts.  Using only intaglio and dry point, she reanimates the detail of “Old Master” prints, while examining the sexual and social themes of the present.   Each piece represents a specific narrative, with images woven together from modern media, classic, and ancient representations.  Some pieces explore her own experiences of uprisings in other countries where ritual practice helped defeat modern dictatorship- a paradigm in which the fantastic or the bizarre imagination may thwart the thrust of our own American religious right.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.reynoldsnart.com/">http://www.reynoldsnart.com/</a></p>


	<p>Lili White:</p>


	<p>Using stylized gestures as a mode of ritualistic format and screen performance, Lili White’s modus operandi is often an exploration on the subject of relationships of power and repression; sometimes drawing from ancient stories re-contextualized into meditations on the world in which we live and the ramifications of inaction and stagnation.  Influenced by art history; informed by Eastern philosophy and psychological theory, her content highlights nature, myth, dreams, archetypal imagery and language.</p>


	<p>Lili White has exhibited her videos in shows in the United States, Germany, England, Ireland and China. Her work has been called “a magical act” and is influenced by her painting studies at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.</p>
