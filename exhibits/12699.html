  <p>Opening Sat. Jan. 15th, 7-11pm
On view Jan. 16th through February 6th during normal gallery hours</p>


	<p>Pandemic presents:</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">TRESPASS</span></strong></p>


	<p><em>Curated by Evan Robarts</em></p>


	<pre><code>A group show featuring 10 young artists working in different media and vernaculars. Along with the traditional meaning of the word, TRESPASS violates social conventions and openly engages in the taboo. TRESPASS places private moments in a public exhibition, where the act of viewing invades personal boundaries. TRESPASS questions established and preconceived notions of art.</code></pre>


	<p><span class="caps">TRESPASS</span> is an action, a state of mind, an invitation.</p>


	<p>The show will feature a wide array of styles and mediums. Painting, sculpture, photography, video, and more. The artists themselves represent a new age of aesthetic visionaries and emerging inspirations. The visual mix, in perfect tandem, will provide a glimpse into a world of stimulating beauty often hidden from view.</p>
