	<p><em>Everything That Rises Must Converge</em> is a group exhibition that explores the connection between six emerging photographers and their neighborhoods.  A dialogue is formed between these photographers and their immediate surroundings that helps shape their art and is expressed through a personal narrative in their work. The photographers have become ambassadors for their neighborhoods, communicating the stories, feelings and idiosyncrasies that surround them.</p>

	<p><strong>Andrew Laumann</strong> was born in the spring of 1987 in Baltimore, MD, where he currently resides. He did not attend College, after high school he spent 4 years traveling and living around the country.

	<p><strong>950 Hart Gallery</strong> began in October of 2010 as an experiment in developing a community art experience. The community from which it operates is the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick. Since its conception it has featured work by over 40 artists located in and around the Bushwick area. With shows themed around love, community, and hope. The galleries have operated with the heartfelt belief that a rising tide will lift all boats. Their energy has been the tide and our boats are roped together.</p>
