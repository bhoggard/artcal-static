<strong>Weekends only:</strong> 12 – 7pm (6-7pm is cocktail hour) or by appointment </p>


	<p><em>Everything That Rises Must Converge</em> is a group exhibition that explores the connection between six emerging photographers and their neighborhoods.  A dialogue is formed between these photographers and their immediate surroundings that helps shape their art and is expressed through a personal narrative in their work. The photographers have become ambassadors for their neighborhoods, communicating the stories, feelings and idiosyncrasies that surround them.</p>

	<p>Born to a Cuban mother and Puerto Rican father in New York City, and raised in Florida, photographer <strong>Joseph Michael Lopez</strong> began working as a documentary cinematographer, notably on the critically acclaimed Bruce Weber film, Chop Suey. Lopez’s recent solo work has been exhibited in New York and Berlin. He studied with photographer at Columbia University, where he holds an M.F.A. Lopez’s work has appeared on the cover of the Sunday Review of The New York Times and he is a contributor to Agence VU’.</p>

He received his Diploma in 2008 and Fifth Year Certificate in 2009. His work has been published and exhibited throughout the United States. He now lives and works in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>


	<p><strong>Andrew Laumann</strong> was born in the spring of 1987 in Baltimore, MD, where he currently resides. He did not attend College, after high school he spent 4 years traveling and living around the country. His work is concerned with the act of destruction and reconstruction and its affect on the natural and supernatural world. He has multiple publications by the likes of Gottlund Verlag, <span class="caps">JSBJ</span>, &#38; Hamburger Eye, and has been shown nationally and internationally.</p>


	<p><strong>950 Hart Gallery</strong> began in October of 2010 as an experiment in developing a community art experience. The community from which it operates is the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick. Since its conception it has featured work by over 40 artists located in and around the Bushwick area. With shows themed around love, community, and hope. The galleries have operated with the heartfelt belief that a rising tide will lift all boats. Their energy has been the tide and our boats are roped together.</p>
