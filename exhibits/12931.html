  <p>Last Rites Gallery is pleased to announce Stephanie Henderson and her collection of dark surrealistic art entitled “Bread &#38; Circuses”. Stephanie’s work is meticulous and exquisite, with a dramatic element that draws the eye to intricate details and classic craftsmanship.  Similar to other classic oil painters, Henderson uses dramatic illumination to create a multi-dimensional world of enigmatic beauty.   With each delicate stroke of her brush, flowers bloom, bugs crawl, and objects erupt from their tenebrous backdrop emphasizing the intricate detail of each luminous entity.  Using these techniques to combine realism with surrealism the artist creates a world of corporeal dreamscapes, giving the viewer a lucid glimpse into her boundless imagination.</p>


	<p>Stephanie’s work has been displayed in numerous public and private collections around the world. She attended Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota, Florida and graduated from the Center of Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan. She currently works as an adjunct professor of painting and illustration.</p>


	<p>Last Rites Gallery is also pleased to announce Michael Mararian and his collection entitled “Snow White”.</p>


	<p>Mararian reveals his technique as “hand drawn in various paint, dry-brush and ink forms, crudely scratched at times for a gritty, textured aesthetic. He is inspired by new and old journalistic-style photography, vintage graphics, cabinet cards, as well as retro advertisements and post mortem photography.”</p>


	<p>Mararian clearly defines his intent as  “touching upon such topics as gross consumerism, school violence, teenage disappointments, pressures and the slowly growing social isolation that are part of our childhood and adult culture. The use of contradiction is an integral part of my work to magnify the absurdity of any given situation and draw a conflicting reaction from the viewer.”  What can, on one level, be construed as melancholy and cruel, can alternately be viewed as amusing, or even charming. Mararian enjoys letting his audience decide.</p>


	<p>Michael is a graduate of the Art and Theater program at the University of Bridgeport. His work has previously been shown at various galleries around the world. Originally from Andover, Massachusetts, Michael currently lives and works from his studios in Brooklyn and Buffalo, New York.</p>


	<p>About Last Rites Gallery:</p>


	<p>Established in 2008, Last Rites has become a premiere gallery for the Dark Art movement and a haven for artists who prefer to explore the ominous, uncomfortable, and eccentric in their work. Striving to showcase some of the most thought-provoking art in contemporary surrealism, Last Rites creates an atmosphere where the artist can harness limitless expression and the observer can reflect inward, inspired to understand that which resides in us all. Since it’s inception, media accolades now include Juxtapoz, Inked Magazine, Tattoo Society, Hi Fructose, NY Post, and the Channel 11 News. Paul Booth, featured by Rolling Stone as “King of Rock Tattoos”, opened Last Rites after 20 years of contributions to the tattoo and art community. Networks including Discovery, <span class="caps">TLC</span>, MSNBC, and <span class="caps">MTV</span>, continue to share Last Rites&#8217; reputation with the world.</p>
