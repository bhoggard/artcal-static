<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>A rising star  on the contemporary Indian art  scene, Kher is rapidly becoming  well-known for her deeply personal, evocative, and layered imagery. She  explores questions of identity, multiplicity and tradition and yet in her work there  often appears to be a dual-aesthetic at play. What is apparent in Bharti  Kher&#8217;s work is that it locates itself at the crossroads of technological  and ecological dystopias and that her creations continue  to carry redemptive power in their new environments.  The  works move from the morphed body to surfaces encoded with  patterns of exile, immigration, and the crossing of  boundaries.</p>


	<p>This exhibition is comprised of recent sculptures depicting life-sized  objects including an elephant, a tree, a whale heart, and a tea set, and a  series of wall-mounted panels comprised of multi-colored bindis. Employing the  bindi as a central motif in her  work,  Kher uses this tiny object to transform the surfaces of both her  sculptures and her paintings.  Sensual abstract designs  created by the bindi swirl together to form extraordinary textured surfaces  resembling a cloth or membrane that gently hugs and accentuates the folds and  weight of the elephant’s skin, the heart’s chambers, and the visually  arresting compositions of the paintings.</p>


	<p>Derived from  bindu,  the Sanskrit word for a dot or a point, the bindi is a forehead  decoration traditionally made with red pigment and worn by Hindu men and  women. It represents the “third eye” the all knowing intrinsic wisdom. In  recent times this divine symbol has become secular; nevertheless Kher takes  advantage of the visual and conceptual underpinning of her source material and  its cultural significance and uses the bindi as a marker or sign and now her  signature.</p>


	<p>The bindi  becomes that leitmotif that connects disparate ideas and things. Kher  expresses a need to cast a common link, and through that the need to gravitate  towards stability, the center, like the bindi, when so many things in the  conflicted world are unstable and out of control.</p>


	<p>Animals, a recurring theme in Kher’s work, serve as a metaphor for the  body and transformation, appearing here in miniature as warnings on her  life-size tree, life-size as a female elephant, and a small organ from the  largest ever of mammals: the whale. The elephant titled The Skin Speaks a  Language Not Its Own is full of pathos; the viewer is unsure whether death  or recovery is the next stage for this creature.</p>


	<p>The  disembodied whale heart is exemplary of Kher’s play with scale and binary  oppositions. The associations, prompting nautical  fantasies but also reminding us of the proximate threat of extinction. For  Kher this vision of the largest organ of any known being on earth forms “a  link between the elephant and the tree”.</p>


	<p>From a larger  perspective, Kher&#8217;s work is a highly personal vision of a society  maladjusted to the vagaries of market forces and the effects of  displacement on one hand and the growing disconnect with the animal world on  the other. I like to call her work an exploration of &#8220;in-betweeness:&#8221; it  traces the relationship between the interior and exterior, humans  and animals, and technology and nature.</p>
