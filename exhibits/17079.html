<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Pace Prints is pleased to present <em>Harmony &#38; Discord</em>, an exhibition of new works by <strong>Shepard Fairey</strong>, created in the Pace Editions studios in New York.  This is Shepard’s first exhibition with Pace Prints and premiers his first works in handmade paper as well as the largest screenprints he has done to date.</p>


	<p>Harmony &#38; Discord references the global dichotomy of politics; what forces it creates on the grand scale and how that reflects on the actions and awareness of the individual. Responding to the energy of New York, Fairey worked on this technically complex body of work in a series of sessions at the Pace Editions studios.  During this residency he also went out on the streets and made a number of large murals.</p>


	<p>On view will be a number of silkscreens done with collage and spraypaint, as well as handmade paper, embossment and relief prints, and large metal plates with screenprint.  Though Shepard approached the work in the same way that he does in his studio, Pace Editions provided the opportunity to scale the work to a larger size.  Relating to the surfaces of his street work, the hand painted multiple (HPM) works in this series have backgrounds of stenciled pulp, collage, screenprint and embossment, allowing the image to pop off of its vintage, layered surface.  This exhibition also marks the first time Fairey presents metal relief plates as art pieces, layered with silkscreen, furthering spatial extent within the work.</p>


	<p>Subjects in the exhibition include Fairey’s <em>Imperial Glory</em> and <em>Power</em> images, both of which pay homage to Lichtenstein’s style while referencing issues of the military industrial complex.  Also on view will be <em>The Reagan and Friends Series</em>, depicting politicians and corporate bosses as manipulative salesmen. A more graphic grouping of works, which all utilize the target as a device, examines symbols, stereotypes and propaganda. Topics include war and peace, political corruption, global warming, and personal empowerment and responsibility.</p>


	<p>Shepard Fairey is the man behind <span class="caps">OBEY GIANT</span>, the graphics that have changed the way people see art and the urban landscape.  Fairey’s work reached a new level of recognition in 2008, when his <span class="caps">HOPE</span> portrait of Barack Obama became the iconic image of the presidential campaign and helped inspire an unprecedented political movement.  As Fairey’s body of work reached its 20-year mark in 2009, the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston honored him with a full-scale solo retrospective, which drew a record number of visitors for the museum. Entitled Supply and Demand, the exhibit shares its name with Fairey’s career-chronicling book. After its time in Boston, the Supply and Demand exhibition made additional runs at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, PA, and the Center for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati, OH, also breaking attendance records in both museums. In May 2010, Fairey unveiled a new collection of work, entitled <span class="caps">MAY DAY</span>, through Deitch Projects as the world-renowned gallery’s final project.  In 2011 Shepard was featured in the Art in the Street exhibition at the <span class="caps">MOCA</span> Geffen in Los Angeles.  Fairey’s Protester image was the cover of Time magazine’s Person of the Year 2011 issue.</p>


	<p>Founded in 1968, Pace Prints is a dealer and publisher of contemporary prints and is affiliated with the Pace Gallery.  Pace Prints is a member of the Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA) and the International Fine Print Dealers Association (IFPDA).</p>
