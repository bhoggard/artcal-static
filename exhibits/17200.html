  <p><strong>As part of our sixtieth anniversary celebration, Aperture Foundation, in collaboration with our partners presents the exhibition Delpire &#38; Co. featuring a half century of achievement in the life and career of visionary French publisher, editor, and curator Robert Delpire, who has realized some of the most groundbreaking projects—in books, magazines, exhibitions, and advertising campaigns—in the history of photography.</p>


	<p>Aperture Gallery, The Gallery at Hermès, Cultural Services of the French Embassy, and La Maison Française of New York University</strong></p>


	<p>Over the past sixty years, the eyes and instincts of <strong>Robert Delpire</strong> have shaped much of the world’s understanding of photography. A prolific publisher and exhibition organizer, with a razor-sharp comprehension of the graphic arts, Delpire has had a defining hand in the careers of many of the master photographers of recent history.</p>


	<p><em>Delpire &#38; Co.</em> (Delpire et Cie, in the original French) was one of the highlights of the Rencontres d’Arles in summer 2009, and was subsequently given a major presentation at la Maison Européenne de la Photographie in Paris from October 2009 to January 2010 with the continued support of the Fondation d’entreprise Hermès.</p>


	<p>The exhibition showcases Delpire’s rise to prominence in the world of photography through his pioneering and seminal work in magazine and book publishing, films, curatorship, and advertising for the past fifty years.</p>


	<p><em>Delpire &#38; Co.</em> will be divided among four different venues, creating altogether a comprehensive exhibition on Delpire’s many initiatives. Howard Greenberg Gallery and Pace/MacGill Gallery will also have exhibitions concurrently on view in celebration of Robert Delpire’s life and work.</p>

	<p><strong><span class="caps">ROBERT DELPIRE BIOGRAPHY</span></strong></p>


	<p>At just twenty-three years old, Robert Delpire founded Neuf, an art magazine that brought together a range of artists, writers, and thinkers, among them André Breton, Jacques Prévert, Henry Miller, Henri Michaux, and Jean-Paul Sartre. In the early 1950s, he began to publish the work of photographers who were later to be recognized as major figures in the genre—Cartier-Bresson, Brassaï, Doisneau, Lartigue, and Bischof—and in 1958 he published Robert Frank’s seminal work The Americans. Delpire was awarded a Gold Medal for Graphic Arts and was a multiple winner of the Nadar Prize.</p>


	<p>In 1955 he created the visual concept for the review L’Oeil, where he continued to serve as artistic director for the following eight years.</p>


	<p>In 1963, he opened rue de l’Abbaye, a gallery which would display the work of leading photographers, illustrators, and graphic artists such as André François, Savignac, Alain Le Foll, Saul Steinberg, and Herb Lubalin, Milton Glaser, and Bob Blechman.</p>


	<p>He also founded a PR company that, as a subsidiary of the Advico Group, handled numerous international accounts. As creative director, he twice won the Grand Prix for publicity, first in 1968 for la Banque Nationale de Paris, and in 1975 for Citroën. In addition to producing advertising films, he also produced the classic short Corps Profond (In the Depths of the Human Body, 1963), as well as the William Klein films Qui êtes Vous Polly Maggoo (Jean Vigo Prize, 1967) and Cassius le Grand. Delpire himself was the director of Flagrants Delits, a thirty-minute film on the work of Cartier-Bresson.</p>


	<p>In 1982 he was appointed by French Minister of Culture Jack Lang as head of France’s Centre national de la Photographie (CNP). There, he founded and published Photo Poche, the first portable paperback series devoted to photography. He produced television programs such as Une minute pour une image and Contacts, 150 explorations of particular themes such as identity, botany, vanity, etc., and monographs of numerous leading photographers, including Irving Penn, Robert Frank, and William Klein, which have since been broadcast around the globe. In 1996, Delpire left the <span class="caps">CNP</span>. The publisher Actes-Sud took over Photo Poche, which assured its continuation as the best selling photographic periodical in the world.</p>


	<p>Delpire continued to publish multiple series of illustrated books under his own name, including Maestro (featured artists included Sarah Moon, which won a 2008 Nadar prize, and Joel-Peter Witkin), Des Images et des Mots (featured artists included Henri Cartier-Bresson, Duane Michals, Ernest Pignon Ernest), and Poche Illustrateur (featured artists included André François, Honoré Daumier, Saul Steinberg). Following the launch of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson in 2002, Delpire was appointed president of the <span class="caps">HCB</span> Award.</p>


	<p>As artistic director of the Fait &#38; Cause gallery, which specializes in social issues, he presented several exhibitions since 1997 such as Jacob Riis, Mary Ellen Mark, Stanley Greene, Robert Doisneau, and Raymond Depardon. He organized and conceived exhibitions such as Henri Cartier-Bresson’s De qui s’agit-il, which is circulating through the world, and many others for the Palazzo della Espozioni in Rome and other major exhibitors and museums in Helsinki, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, London, and Paris, as well as the exhibition La terre vue du ciel, whose installation in the Parc du Luxembourg was seen by millions and achieved a measure of success unprecedented in the history of photography.</p>


	<p>Delpire &#38; Co. is coproduced by Rencontres d’Arles, la Maison Européenne de la Photographie, Delpire Editeur, and Aperture Foundation.</p>
