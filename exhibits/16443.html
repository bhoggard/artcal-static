  <p><strong><span class="caps">AARON OBLVN</span> “100 <span class="caps">PAINTINGS</span>”</strong>
<span class="caps">MARCH 10</span>—APRIL 1, 2012
<span class="caps">OPENING</span>: SATURDAY <span class="caps">MARCH 10</span>, 2012 <span class="caps">FROM 6</span>-10PM
<span class="caps">KLUGHAUS GALLERY</span>
47 Monroe St. New York, <span class="caps">NY 10002</span></p>


	<p>Klughaus Gallery is proud to announce the debut of “100 Paintings,” a solo exhibition of brand new, one-of-a-kind illustrated works by Portland, Oregon-based artist and cartoonist Aaron <span class="caps">OBLVN</span>.  In honor of his first ever east coast show, <span class="caps">OBLVN</span> has been hard at work for months preparing one hundred illustrations exclusively for Klughaus; highlights of the character and cartoon-heavy exhibit include contemporary, tongue-in-cheek remixes of classic cartoon characters like &#8216;Felix The Cat&#8217; as an art thief and &#8216;Dennis the Menace&#8217; as a vandal, as well as many original works, from mischievous spray can characters to runaway inkwells.</p>


	<p>Why one hundred works?  “I’ve been drawing my whole life, but really focusing on this style for about three years now—but not on this scale,” says <span class="caps">OBLVN</span>.  “I read once in a sign painting comic strip by [cartoonist] Justin Green that it takes about 100 hours of brushing before you finally get your lettering down,” says <span class="caps">OBLVN</span> of one of the motives behind sitting down to tackle the daunting task of creating one hundred pieces of art for a single show.  “So I figured if I did 100 characters, I would definitely get some good practice in. I can tell from the first cartoons I started doing a few years ago that I&#8217;ve gotten better. It&#8217;s always great to see your own progress.”</p>


	<p>In addition to breaking the gallery record for the highest number of works in a single show, the breadth and depth of <span class="caps">OBLVN</span>&#8217;s body of playful, accessible work makes &#8220;100 Paintings&#8221; a show with literally something for everyone. “I love cartoons,” he says of his trademark subject matter.  “I’m picky, but I love a lot of styles.  From Vaughn Bode, Basil Wolverton, Skip Williamson, Text Avery, Ralph Bakshi and John K to more contemporary artists like Barry McGee and Todd James.”</p>


	<p>In this vein “100 Paintings” is both a one-of-a-kind body of work as well as a collective ode to the artists <span class="caps">OBLVN</span> emulates, and he is looking forward to piecing together his collection of puzzle pieces in New York City: “I’m really stoked on the work as a whole,” he says.  “So much of my time is spent up close with the pieces, my face only a few inches from my brush and the ink that it’s sort of crazy to step back and see the work as a body.  It’s pretty cool to see how much I cranked out.  It’s so awesome that [the opening] is in NY, but seriously daunting.  I’m excited.”</p>


	<p><strong>The opening for “100 Paintings” will take place Saturday, March 10th from 6-10 pm.  Please <span class="caps">RSVP</span> to <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="8efcfdf8fecee5e2fbe9e6effbfda0e0ebfaa0">[email&#160;protected]</a></strong></p>
