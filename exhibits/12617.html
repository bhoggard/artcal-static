<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>BoxoFFICE is proud to present <em>perhaps we meet</em>, a group exhibition featuring Diane Best, Tina Bluefield, David Goodman, John Luckett and Randy Polumbo. The artists in the exhibition all have strong connections to centers of art practice away from the metropolitan fabric. Living, working, traveling in, amongst and between Joshua Tree, CA and Marfa, TX, they draw inspiration from the independent and open spirit of these locations. Working in various media (photography, painting, drawing and sculpture) these artists create bold artworks channeling the free nature and strong energy of remote centers of creativity. The artists inspire the activities at BoxoFFICE and draw a new audience to reconsider its place in the world and to touch the independent spirit within themselves.</p>


	<p><strong>Diane Best</strong> was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and studied in the San Francisco area (Stanford University, San Francisco Art Institute), before moving south to Los Angeles. Now living in Joshua Tree, CA, Diane has focused her talent exclusively on capturing the dramatic imagery of various desert landscapes. She works in a variety of media including acrylic, graphite, photography and video. Diane&#8217;s work has been presented in solo and group exhibitions in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Joshua Tree, 29 Palms, New Hampshire, New York, and Boston. She was recently featured in an exhibition at the Carnegie Museum in Oxnard, CA and had a solo show at the Southwest Museum in Los Angeles in 2008. Diane also teaches painting workshops in Joshua Tree National Park for the Desert Institute.</p>


	<p><strong>Tina Bluefield</strong> is a lifelong painter. She was raised in Westchester County, New York and then spent thirty years in Colorado. There, Tina made large watercolors of the Colorado landscape and of the Desert Southwest for over a decade. In 1996, Tina received her <span class="caps">BFA</span> in painting (Phi Beta Kappa) from the University of Colorado in Boulder.  At Boulder, she worked with color-field artist Gene Matthews and studied aesthetics with George Woodman. Now, in a  studio she designed and built in Joshua Tree, Tina paints full-time, primarily in oils. She has enjoyed several solo shows in Joshua Tree, Palm Desert and in Twentynine Palms, California, as well as at BoxoFFICE in <span class="caps">NYC</span>, and has participated in numerous group shows.</p>


	<p><strong>David Goodman</strong> is a graduate of Boston University (BFA) and of Indiana University (MFA). He lives and works as an artist/curator/educator in New York City. David has participated in several group exhibitions in New York, Berlin and Basel. He has also written for Bomb magazine, guest lectured at <span class="caps">RISD</span> and moderated several discussion groups for Judd Foundation. His travels to Marfa, TX and the greater SouthWest led to a body of work from which he is exhibiting at BoxoFFICE.</p>


	<p><strong>John Luckett</strong> was born and raised in the deep South, is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and attended the Academy of Art College in San Francisco.  He has exhibited his painting and mixed media work in numerous group shows in Los Angeles, New York, Anchorage and Joshua Tree, and in solo exhibitions in Los Angeles and San Francisco as well as at BoxoFFICE in <span class="caps">NYC</span>. His work has been included in private and corporate collections in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Tokyo, Rome, and London. He is currently living and working in the High Desert near Joshua Tree.</p>


	<p><strong>Randy Polumbo</strong> is a graduate of The Cooper Union, from which he received an award for excellence in sculpture. Randy has been the subject of solo exhibitions at galleries in New York City, Miami, Tallahassee, and 29 Palms, as well as at Vanderbilt University, Illinois Central College and Duke University. Selected group exhibitions include the Kingston Sculpture Biennial, Figment: Governors Island, Burning Man, and High Desert Test Sites as well as numerous gallery and institutional exhibitions from New York City, to Miami to Anchorage. Randy has also been the recipient of several residencies including Shed im Eisenwerk Dogether in Switzerland, The Corporation of Yaddo in Saratoga Springs and the Joshua Tree National Park Stewardship. This last residency is important in that it led to Randy&#8217;s establishing a significant presence in Joshua Tree. There, he co-founded The Art Queen, a gallery and arts center, and he also designed and built a house that has received significant recognition for its blend of architectural and sculptural elements.</p>
