<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>The Jack Hanley Gallery, New York is pleased to present <em>California Investigative Healing</em>, a multisensory exhibit organized by San Francisco-based artist, Kal Spelletich.  Spelletich will unveil, for the first time to a U.S. audience, <em>the Herb Alpert Upper Body Hydro-Pneumatic Pulsation Vacuo Engine</em>, an exercise machine that powers eight different apparatuses, machines, robots and a turntable that plays only Herb Alpert &#38; The Tijuana Brass or <em>Art Machines Purport to Cure The Health Care Crisis</em>!</p>


	<p>The opening night, Thursday, August 6th, will feature a  reading by writer Pete Simonelli, vocalist for San Francisco band the Enablers, as well as a giant robot powered by <em>the Herb Alpert Upper Body Hydro-Pneumatic Pulsation Vacuo Engine</em>.  It walks, crawls, hops and Bar-B-Qs!.  Art cupcakes will also be for sale.</p>


	<p>From San Francisco, California, the healing capitol of the world, Spelletich believes that exercising to Herb Alpert is a visceral transcendence. The body becomes all rhythm and all sound, rapt in a unified sonic event with percussive pressures felt by others from deep within.  Having become wholly expressive from the inside out, from limb to limb, the body “disappears” into the play; and thus it becomes more completely itself.</p>


	<p>Herb Alpert describes the database of consciousness as an electrostatic condenser.  The higher the power of the field of consciousness one is connected to, the greater the capacity of the nervous system and body needs to be in order to handle and integrate higher frequencies.  As Spelletich describes, “What happened was, that some of the lower calibrating fields, coming from unreleased traumata and the connected emotions especially from the radical childhood I had experienced, had not been fully transmuted. Therefore the higher state of consciousness was induced by entrainment with the teacher Herb Alpert and was not integrated. I decided to pursue healing techniqueswith this machine, which helps people to transmute and release the traumata and emotions as well as their effects on the body, psyche and consciousness.  Often those feelings are held in the subconscious and we attract and repeat the same feelings over and over because it is played out by the electromagnetic charge held in the body like a recording.”</p>


	<p>Also available will be the Herb Alpert Sexual Healing Herbal Linament and Pharmaceutical which claims to help cure and improve all of the following and more: Acne, Allergies, Amenorrhea, Aphrodisiacs, Aphtous ulcers, Asthma &#38; Bronchitis, Hypercholesterolaemia, Blocked Arteries (in most cases patients can avoid by-pass surgery), Circulation of Brain &#38; Legs, Constipation, Dandruff, Depression, Diabetes, Eczema, Epilepsy, Gastritis, falling Hair, premature graying of Hair (especially for those over and under 35 years old), child’s Hyperactivity, Influenza, Insomnia, Kidney failure, Kidney stone, bad Memory, Venereal Diseases of all types, Menopause, Migraine, Nervousness, Piles, Prostatitis (patients can avoid surgery in most cases), Renal failure, Psoriasis, Rheumatism (osteo &#38; rheumatoid), Sinusitis, Stress, Tiredness, Ulcerative colitis, Ureamia, Varicose veins, Blood, Liver and Stomach rejuvinatop,Weight loss.</p>


	<p><em>Mock Up On MU</em> by San Francisco filmmaker Craig Baldwin will be screened throughout the run of the exhibit.  Released in 2008, <em>Mock Up On MU</em> intercuts pulp-serial snippets, industrial-film imagery, and B- (and Z-) fiction clips with newly shot live-action material, powering a playful, allegorical trajectory through the now-mythic occult matrix of Jack Parsons (Crowleyite founder of the Jet Propulsion Lab), L.Ron Hubbard (sci-fi author turned cult- leader), and Marjorie Cameron (bohemian artist and &#8220;mother of the New Age movement&#8221;). Their intertwined tales spin out into a speculative farce on the militarization of space, and the corporate take-over of spiritual fulfillment and leisure-time. (110m: 16mm-to-video)</p>


	<p><em>The Herb Alpert Upper Body Hydro-Pneumatic Pulsation Vacuo Engine</em> was exhibited in March, 2009 at the Dark Fair in Cologne Germany.</p>


	<p>Kal Spelletich received his <span class="caps">MFA</span> from the University of Texas at Austin and currently lives and works in San Francisco, CA. Spelletich helped found <span class="caps">SEEMEN</span>, a collective of individuals who enjoy building extreme machines and robots that they allow their audience to operate.  He has also worked with the machine performance art group, Survival Research Laboratories.</p>


	<p>Craig Baldwin is an experimental filmmaker who lives and works in San Francisco, CA.  His work commonly uses “found” footage from the fringes of popular consciousness as well as images from the mass media to undermine and transform the traditional documentary, infusing it with the energy of high-speed montage and a provocative commentary that targets subjects from intellectual property rights to rampant consumerism.  Baldwin founded Other Cinema, an outlet for the presentation of experimental film, video and performance in San Francisco, CA.</p>
