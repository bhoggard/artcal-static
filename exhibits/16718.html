<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p>Jeff Bailey Gallery is pleased to present <strong>Pitch</strong>, an exhibition of recent sculpture by Lonnie Holley,
Fabienne Lasserre and Halsey Rodman.</p>


	<p>Each artist combines disparate materials in innovative ways, resulting in works that hover
between painting, drawing and sculpture.</p>


	<p>Lonnie Holley’s sculptures are made of found materials as strong as concrete and as delicate as
ribbon. In <em>Lifting Me Over</em>, wire, steel and concrete are twisted together to form a line drawing
in space, revealing multiple facial proﬁles.  A large paperclip suspends wire, burlap, rock,
wood and torn drawings in <em>Hanging in the Business</em>.  As Holley has often stated, he seeks to
give new life to materials that are typically discarded.</p>


	<p>The three parts of Halsey Rodman’s sculpture, _Gradually/We Became Aware/Of A Hum In The
Room_, function as color anchors in the exhibition.  Horizontal triangles are mounted in corners
of the gallery at varying heights, their yellow color puncturing these out of the way spaces.
<em>Phantom Construct/Prism/Tears In Rain</em>, a standing three-sided sculpture on steel supports,
features a near-identical abstract painting on each side.  The paintings have been executed
sequentially with the same shapes and colors, calling attention to the development of a
composition, repetition, and the passage of time.</p>


	<p>Fabienne Lasserre’s <em>Pitchables</em> function as paintings with undulating protrusions. Composed of linen strips and splotches of paint, fabric covered wire loops outward from the picture plane.  <em>Incomplete Act</em> rests on the ﬂoor and features a slender white and brown form gently curving in midair.  This is circled by an oval made of clay and linen.  Lasserre stretches and elongates surface and form into both positive and negative spaces.</p>


	<p><strong>Lasserre’s</strong> work was recently included in the Québec Triennial at the Musée d&#8217;art contemporain
de Montréal, Canada.  She had a solo exhibition with the gallery in 2011.  She has exhibited in
numerous solo and group exhibitions: Gallery Diet, Miami (solo), Elizabeth Foundation for the
Arts, Regina Rex, Kansas Gallery (group), and Espacio Matucana 100, Santiago, Chile (group).
She is a 2008-09 recipient of the La Curtiduría residency in Oaxaca, Mexico.  She received her
<span class="caps">MFA</span> from Columbia University in 2004.  Lasserre lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.</p>


	<p><strong>Lonnie Holley</strong> is a self-taught artist who has been exhibiting for over 30 years.  He had a solo
exhibition at the gallery in 2010.  His work is included in numerous public collections:
American Folk Art Museum, New York; Birmingham Museum of Art, Alabama; High Museum of
Art, Atlanta; Milwaukee Museum of Art, Wisconsin; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston;
Philadelphia Museum of Art, Pennsylvania; Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington,
D.C., among others.  Holley lives and works in Harpersville, Alabama.</p>


	<p><strong>Halsey Rodman</strong> had two solo exhibitions at Guild and Greyshkul and his work was included in
group exhibitions at Sue Scott Gallery and Laurel Gitlen, New York.  Solo presentations of his
work were included in Portugal Arte 10, Lisbon and <em>Evidence of Bricks</em> at the Portland Institute
of Contemporary Art.  He received his <span class="caps">MFA</span> from Columbia University in 2003. Rodman lives and
works in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
