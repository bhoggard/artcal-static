  <p>Little Cakes Little Gallery in association with <span class="caps">HPGRP</span> Gallery presents
Forever Home &#8211; a two part benefit for New York City Animal Care and Control&#8217;s 
&#8220;Big Fix&#8221; and &#8220;STAR&#8221; programs</p>


	<p>New York City is home to many happily pampered pets; dogs that run and play at dog runs, cats that dine on organic, grain-free meals, animals that are cherished as part of the family. Unfortunately, at the same time, the city overflows with unwanted pets. New York City Animal Care and Control (NYCAC&#38;C), the non-profit organization contracted by the city&#8217;s Health Department, takes in over 40,000 of these animals every year through out the five boroughs. It has the tough task of having to admit every single animal surrendered to them, whereas other agencies may pick and choose or deny admission. Our hope for Forever Home is not only to raise money for AC&#38;C&#8217;s programs but to also help promote them as an alternative to purchasing a pet and to inspire viewers to get involved and volunteer, if not at AC&#38;C, with any organization that deals with issues they feel passionately about. During the run of the two exhibitions, there will be one day volunteer opportunities at Little Cakes Gallery to make cage comforters and kitty toys for those who want to get their feet wet. Please check the Little Cakes website for times and dates.</p>


	<p>Participating artists:</p>


	<p>Ports Bishop is a photographer raised in Peterborough, NH. He now lives and works in New York City and is on the faculty at the International Center of Photography. He recently had a solo show at PH Gallery in Chelsea and has published a monograph titled &#8220;Future Friends&#8221; through HP France, NY. He is planning on showing photographs taken at Yellowstone National Park of how people watch animals.</p>


	<p>Mark Borthwick, although internationally known as a sought after fashion photographer, is an artist who melds his many talents; photography, music, poetry, film, drawing, and cooking to create beautiful installations and happenings that evoke both light and love. He has worked with musicians such as Cat Power and Sonic Youth, designers Vanessa Bruno, Martin Margiela, and his own wife Maria Cornejo, magazines like i-D, Purple, and Italian Vogue just to name a few. Mark will be showing an installation made up of photos, works on paper, and flowers in celebration of a donkey he fell in love with.</p>


	<p>Knox is an acclaimed and award winning photographer known for his emotional and gritty take on street and urban life. His photos can be seen in books and magazines around the world. His Urban Tails book (2006) and ongoing project is a photo journalistic take of alley cats at the intersection of nature and industry. It documents the photographer&#8217;s relationship with these street warriors and his subsequent rescue operation to trap, neuter, and return them to their original environment. Urban Tails is a powerful testament to such operations as well as the hearts, spirit and courage of these alley cats which gives viewers a glimpse into a hidden world of lives that while not ideal, can be filled with beauty and love.</p>


	<p>Aliya Naumoff is a NY based photographer, shooting portraits and fashion for various magazines around the world. Her love for animals drove her to start an animal awareness organization called <span class="caps">SES</span> (Save Endangered Species) at age 10.</p>


	<p>Kurt Mangum currently resides in the city of New York. Born and raised in the landscape of the Midwest he taught himself how to see the beauty in day to day life that most others over look.</p>
