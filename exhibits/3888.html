<div class="span-16 last exhibit-description">
  <p><em>The Nightly News</em> is an exhibition of works by artists from around the world, some showing in New York for the first time. These artists were born in Iraq, Iran, Palestine, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Belgium, Poland, Mexico and Finland, as well as the United States. Current events and issues such terrorism, war, surveillance, xenophobia, racism, religious fanaticism, immigration, nationalism, and the abuse of power drive the exhibition.</p>


	<p><strong>Christodoulous Panayiotou&#8217;s</strong> video <em>Alkadaslar</em> depicting jet fighters drawing a heart in the sky was commissioned at the British military base in Cyprus. <strong>Ahmet Ogut&#8217;s</strong> video <em>Light Armoured</em> is an animation features a Land Rover, transformed into a tank, being hit with stones thrown from off-screen. Despite the fact that the image is generic with no national identification, the Turkish police shut it down believing it incited terrorism. Paranoia is also the subject of <strong>Dominik Lejman&#8217;s</strong> video of ice skaters at Rockefeller Center unknowingly being spied upon by surveillance helicopters.</p>


	<p><strong>Jackie Salloum&#8217;s</strong> cleverly packaged mock toy called Caterrorpillar enthusiastically advertises its effectiveness in destroying Palestinian homes, commenting on Israel&#8217;s use of American made Caterpillar bulldozers.  <strong>Lydia Venieri</strong> also ironically conflates war and play in her deceptively saccharine photographs of dolls whose eyes reflect the conflicts they see around the world. An ineffectual and contrite Superman can be seen flying over the remains of Falluja after the US invasion of the Iraqi city in <strong>Al Fadhil&#8217;s</strong> photo-collage. An accompanying photograph retells the plight of immigrants who feel compelled to leave their troubled homelands.</p>


	<p><strong>Fred Wilson</strong> also addresses immigration and the persistent xenophobia that permeates Western society in his work. His moors holding candelabras are modern replicas of an 18th Century stereotype still ubiquitous in Venice. These figures represent the explosive potential of continued racism and anti-Muslim bias around the world and a plea to put out the flames. Lieven De Boeck also sees alternatives in his <em>White Flag</em> project. This installation presents the 192 flags of the United Nations members stripped of national or ideological symbolism. All crosses, stars, crescents, eagles, etc. are cut away and the colors fade to white, the color of peace and negotiation.</p>


	<p><strong>Michael Waugh&#8217;s</strong> drawing, <em>Heading East, Heading West</em>, uses images and text from a <span class="caps">WWII</span> era book on submarine warfare combined with a Nautica ad. His submarines fly the Nazi and Texas flags respectively.  <strong>Liselot van der Heijen</strong> deals more specifically with our Texan-in-Chief. Her video, <em>See Evil, Hear Evil, Speak Evil</em> is a parody of the deceptive and manipulative use of language in which she has eliminated all but the word evil from George Bush&#8217;s State of the Union address. <strong>Michael Zansky</strong> also addresses US politics with his images showing a Dorian Gray version of Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld visible despite their placid exteriors. This work is a literal interpretation of Walter Benjamin&#8217;s pessimistic view that history is best understood through an analysis of the debris that it leaves behind.</p>


	<p>The media is the subject of <strong>Pedro Lasch&#8217;s</strong> rapid-fire video consisting of stills taken from the <span class="caps">BBC</span> and other sources showing figures in masks and hoods. Pia Lindman transforms photographs of grieving people taken from the front page of the New York Times, reproducing these images by means of simple line drawings and mimicing their actions. Similarly, the collaborative team, <strong>caraballo-farman</strong> manipulates and simplifes newspaper images of grief-stricken individuals from the Mid-East conflict. The rich darks and deep shadows in these photographs recall old master paintings and the universal nature of sorrow depicted in them.</p>


	<p>Holland Cotter calls <strong>Robert Boyd&#8217;s</strong> video series <em>Xanadu</em> a &#8220;trailer for the Apocalypse&#8221; set to a disco beat. <em>Heaven&#8217;s Little Helper</em>, a segment from this epic, uses footage of Doomsday-cult gurus and their disciples to expose the religious fanaticism rampant today. Jody Culkin&#8217;s version of a burqa, the garb worn by conservative Islamic women and sometimes forced upon them by men, is an alternative to what has become, whether right or wrong, a symbol of religious
intolerance. Her garment is made of diaphanous material and is equipped with motorized wings for a quick escape.</p>


	<p>Curated by Kathleen Goncharov and Stephan Stoyanov</p>
