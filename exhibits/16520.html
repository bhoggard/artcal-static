  <p>Today
Frank O&#8217;Hara, 1950.</p>


	<p>Oh! Kangaroos, sequins, chocolate sodas!
You really are beautiful! Pearls,
harmonicas, jujubes, asprins! all
the stuff they&#8217;ve always talked about</p>


	<p>still makes a poem a surprise!
These things are with us every day
even on beachheads and biers. They
do have meaning. They&#8217;re strong as rocks.</p>


	<p>Lisa Cooley is thrilled to announce the opening of <em>Today</em>, the first exhibition in our new space at 107 Norfolk Street, one block east of Essex between Delancey and Rivington. The new gallery is a 4,800 square-foot, single-story structure with two exhibition spaces and 14 foot wood-beamed ceilings. The inaugural exhibition will feature major works by each gallery artist and is titled after a Frank O&#8217;Hara poem.</p>


	<p>The opening reception will be on Friday, March 16th, from 6 until 9 pm.</p>
