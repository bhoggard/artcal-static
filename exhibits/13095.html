  <p><strong><span class="caps">STOREFRONT</span></strong> (16 Wilson Avenue, Brooklyn) presents a new exhibition titled <strong><span class="caps">JUX</span>: new painting by <span class="caps">ANDY SPENCE</span> + <span class="caps">COLIN THOMSON</span></strong>. <span class="caps">JUX</span> is an exhibition that brings together, or juxtaposes, two seasoned New York painters in a lively exhibition to examine and consider their diverse treatment of subject, color, drawing, and editing. While both Andy Spence and Colin Thomson paint abstractly, their methods and results could not be more different. <span class="caps">JUX</span> encourages the viewer to participate in the conversation created between two very different approaches to painting.</p>


	<p>Also on exhibit in the backroom at Storefront are new still-life paintings by Bushwick based artist Amy Lincoln.</p>


	<p>An opening reception for the artists will be held Friday, February 25, from 6-9PM. Storefront is open weekends 1-6PM or by appointment by calling 646-361-8512.  For more information visit <a href="http://www.storefrontbk.com">www.storefrontbk.com</a></p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">ANDY SPENCE</span></strong> is best known for his simplification of the subject and the relationship between abstraction and reference. Spence’s fascination with commonplace design has served as a starting point for much of his work. Each painting has different visual dualities such as spatial illusions, tactility and balance. Upon completion, the original sources are transformed and sometimes completely forgotten. Color is the reinforcing structure. In this new group of paintings, Spence’s structural format loosens, revealing his process.</p>


	<p>Spence received his <span class="caps">BFA</span> from Tyler School of Art of Temple University in 1969 and his <span class="caps">MFA</span> from UC Santa Barbara in 1971. He has been teaching at Bennington College in VT since 1994. His work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Walker Art Center, San Diego Museum of Art, among others. Spence lives and works in New York City.  For more information on Andy Spence visit:  <a href="http://www.andrewspenceart.com">www.andrewspenceart.com</a></p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">COLIN THOMSON</span></strong> derives his compositions from a mixture of graphics and indigenous patterns that recall the early pictographs of Adolph Gottlieb. His paintings are a playful yet focused investigation of the relationship between figure and ground, color and drawing. Thomson’s narrative extends not only between his hieroglyphic figures but also includes the &#8216;ground&#8217; in which they exist. Unlike his earlier works, which were thickly layered, these new works are ‘fast.’ Patches of raw canvas are left uncovered and the brush indicates sure drawing and a strong feeling for scale. Thomson, however, retains and expands upon his original subject, matter responding with a wry inventiveness to architectural plans, Islamic tiles, and skewed color registration.</p>


	<p>Thomson received his BA from Lake Forest College in 1971 and his <span class="caps">MFA</span> from Yale University in 1977. He is the recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship in 1991-92. His work is in the collections of the Grey Art Gallery, New York University; Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Weathersppon Art Gallery, and Centro Culturale, Arte Contemporaneo, Mexico City, among others. This fall, Thomson’s paintings will be featured at the Wexford Art Center in Bunclody, Republic of Ireland. Thomson lives and works in New York City.

	<p><strong><span class="caps">ALSO</span>, ON <span class="caps">EXHIBIT IN THE BACKROOM</span> @ <span class="caps">STOREFRONT</span></strong>:  <strong><span class="caps">AMY LINCOLN</span>: new still life paintings</strong>.</p>


	<p><strong><span class="caps">AMY LINCOLN</span></strong> is a Brooklyn, New York-based artist who makes detailed, allegorical paintings of still lifes, portraits and interiors, often combining these genres into a single image. The objects and spaces in her paintings depict her personal surroundings, her home, her possessions, the view from her apartment. The imagery also creates an internal dialogue with the history of painting, particularly works by northern Renaissance artists like Hans Holbein, Jan Van Eyck, and Petrus Christus.</p>


	<p>A Portland, Oregon native, Lincoln studied painting at the University of California Davis, Brandeis University, and the Tyler School of Art, where she earned her <span class="caps">MFA</span>. She moved to New York in 2006 upon receiving a Swing Space Residency from the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council.  Lincoln exhibits her work nationally and internationally, in cities such as New York, Tokyo, Philadelphia, Boston, and Portland, OR.   She is also active in the emerging gallery scene of Bushwick, where she helps run The Laundromat, an exhibition program, out of her apartment.
